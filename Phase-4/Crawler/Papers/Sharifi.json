        "abstract": "It is shown that FGF4 and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibitors, designated R2i, not only provide the ground state pluripotency in production and maintenance of na\u00efve ES cells from blastocysts of different mouse strains, but also maintain ES cells with higher genomic integrity following long-term cultivation compared with the chemical inhibition of the FGF 4 and GSK3 pathways. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are considered to exist in a ground state if shielded from differentiation triggers. Here we show that FGF4 and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibitors, designated R2i, not only provide the ground state pluripotency in production and maintenance of na\u00efve ES cells from blastocysts of different mouse strains, but also maintain ES cells with higher genomic integrity following long-term cultivation compared with the chemical inhibition of the FGF4 and GSK3 pathways, known as 2i. Global transcriptome analysis of the ES cells highlights augmented BMP4 signaling pathway. The crucial role of the BMP4 pathway in maintaining the R2i ground state pluripotency is demonstrated by BMP4 receptor suppression, resulting in differentiation and cell death. In conclusion, by inhibiting TGF\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways, we introduce a novel defined approach to efficiently establish the ground state pluripotency.",

Despite the enormous progress in studying definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), none of the reported protocols have produced a universal, cost-effective, and competent DE with the capability to further differentiate into endodermal derivatives. In this study, by using a 2-step differentiation strategy, we have treated hESCs for 1 day with \"priming\" small molecules (SM), [stauprimide, NSC-308848, rapamycin (Rapa), and/or CHIR] and for the next 3 days with \"inducing\" SM (LY294002, cymarin, IDE1, and/or IDE2) in conjunction with activin A. In the positive control group, we treated hESCs with Wnt3a (25\u2009ng/mL) for 1 day and activin A (100\u2009ng/mL; W/A100-A100) for the next 3 days. Gene expression analysis showed that treatment of hESCs with 100\u2009nM Rapa and 50\u2009ng/mL activin A (Rapa-A50) out of 25 combinations of factors gave rise to higher expressions of 2 DE-specific genes, SOX17 and FOXA2. Similar results were obtained after treating 2 other hESC lines with this regimen. To investigate the competency of Rapa-A50-induced DE for further differentiation into endodermal derivatives, these cells and W/A100-A100-induced DE cells (positive control) were further differentiated into pancreatic progenitors (PP), then into pancreatic endocrine (PE) cells using 5 previously described differentiation protocols. Gene analysis of differentiated cells showed that the established protocols were insufficient to enable universal differentiation into PE, whereas Rapa-A50-induced DE cells were more competent for PP differentiation in a protocol-dependent manner. Additionally, Rapa-A50-induced DE had the capability to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) as efficiently as W/A100-A100-induced DE. These data have indicated that hESCs primed with Rapa, and induced by a lower concentration of activin A, could lead to DE that had the capability to further differentiate into HLCs and PP cells, but not PE cells. Thus, current protocols for the differentiation of DE into PE still need additional study.",

        "abstract": "This article introduces the GTED problem and gives the first polynomial time algorithm for it, which is motivated by and provides the first mathematical formalism for sequence co-assembly and de novo variation detection in bioinformatics. Many problems in applied machine learning deal with graphs (also called networks), including social networks, security, web data mining, protein function prediction, and genome informatics. The kernel paradigm beautifully decouples the learning algorithm from the underlying geometric space, which renders graph kernels important for the aforementioned applications. In this article, we give a new graph kernel, which we call graph traversal edit distance (GTED). We introduce the GTED problem and give the first polynomial time algorithm for it. Informally, the GTED is the minimum edit distance between two strings formed by the edge labels of respective Eulerian traversals of the two graphs. Also, GTED is motivated by and provides the first mathematical formalism for sequence co-assembly and de novo variation detection in bioinformatics. We demonstrate that GTED admits a polynomial time algorithm using a linear program in the graph product space that is guaranteed to yield an integer solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to this problem. We also give a linear programming relaxation algorithm for a lower bound on GTED. We use GTED as a graph kernel and evaluate it by computing the accuracy of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on a few data sets in the literature. Our results suggest that our kernel outperforms many of the common graph kernels in the tested data sets. As a second set of experiments, we successfully cluster viral genomes using GTED on their assembly graphs obtained from de novo assembly of next-generation sequencing reads.",

DNA methylation at promoters is largely correlated with inhibition of gene expression. However, the role of DNA methylation at enhancers is not fully understood, although a crosstalk with chromatin marks is expected. Actually, there exist contradictory reports about positive and negative correlations between DNA methylation and H3K4me1, a chromatin hallmark of enhancers. We investigated the relationship between DNA methylation and active chromatin marks through genome-wide correlations, and found anti-correlation between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 enrichment at low and intermediate DNA methylation loci. We hypothesized \u201cseesaw\u201d dynamics between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in the low and intermediate DNA methylation range, in which DNA methylation discriminates between enhancers and promoters, marked by H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, respectively. Low methylated regions are H3K4me3 enriched, while those with intermediate DNA methylation levels are progressively H3K4me1 enriched. Additionally, the enrichment of H3K27ac, distinguishing active from primed enhancers, follows a plateau in the lower range of the intermediate DNA methylation level, corresponding to active enhancers, and decreases linearly in the higher range of the intermediate DNA methylation. Thus, the decrease of the DNA methylation switches smoothly the state of the enhancers from a primed to an active state. We summarize these observations into a rule of thumb of one-out-of-three methylation marks: \u201cIn each genomic region only one out of these three methylation marks {DNA methylation, H3K4me1, H3K4me3} is high. If it is the DNA methylation, the region is inactive. If it is H3K4me1, the region is an enhancer, and if it is H3K4me3, the region is a promoter\u201d. To test our model, we used available genome-wide datasets of H3K4 methyltransferases knockouts. Our analysis suggests that CXXC proteins, as readers of non-methylated CpGs would regulate the \u201cseesaw\u201d mechanism that focuses H3K4me3 to unmethylated sites, while being repulsed from H3K4me1 decorated enhancers and CpG island shores. Our results show that DNA methylation discriminates promoters from enhancers through H3K4me1-H3K4me3 seesaw mechanism, and suggest its possible function in the inheritance of chromatin marks after cell division. Our analyses suggest aberrant formation of promoter-like regions and ectopic transcription of hypomethylated regions of DNA. Such mechanism process can have important implications in biological process in where it has been reported abnormal DNA methylation status such as cancer and aging.",

        "abstract": "Gene expression profile alterations in cumulus cells from both the IS and IR groups of PCOS patients seems to be involved in the composition and regulation of ECM during the ovulation process. Objective The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) is composed of several molecules that have different roles during follicle development. This study aims to explore gene expression profiles for ECM and cell adhesion molecules in the cumulus cells of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients based on their insulin sensitivity following controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). Materials and Methods In this prospective case-control study enrolled 23 women less than 36 years of age who participated in an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) program. Patients were subdivided into 3 groups: control (n=8, fertile women with male infertility history), insulin resistant (IR) PCOS (n=7), and insulin sensitive (IS) PCOS (n=8). We compared 84 ECM component and adhesion molecule gene expressions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction array (qPCR-array) among the groups. Results We noted that 21 of the 84 studied genes differentially expressed among the groups, from which 18 of these genes downregulated. Overall, comparison of PCOS cases with controls showed downregulation of extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1); catenin (cadherin-associated protein), alpha 1 (CTNNA1); integrin, alpha 5 (ITGA5); laminin, alpha 3 (LAMA3); laminin, beta 1 (LAMB1); fibronectin 1 (FN1); and integrin, alpha 7 (ITGA7). In the IS group, there was upregulation of ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 8 (ADAMTS8) and neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) compared with the controls (P<0.05). Conclusion Downregulation of ECM and cell adhesion molecules seem to be related to PCOS. Gene expression profile alterations in cumulus cells from both the IS and IR groups of PCOS patients seems to be involved in the composition and regulation of ECM during the ovulation process. This study highlights the association of ECM gene alteration as a viewpoint for additional understanding of the etiology of PCOS.",

STUDY QUESTION\nCan transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) inhibition promote ground state pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from single blastomeres (SBs) of cleavage embryos in different mouse stains?\n\n\nSUMMARY ANSWER\nSmall molecule suppression of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and TGF\u03b2 signaling (designated as R2i) can enhance the generation of mouse ESCs from SBs of different cleavage stage embryos compared with the dual suppression of ERK1/2 and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), designated as 2i, regardless of the strain of mouce.\n\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY\nIt is known that chemical inhibition of TGF\u03b2 promotes ground state pluripotency in the generation and sustenance of na\u00efve ES cells from mouse blastocysts compared with the well-known 2i condition. However, the positive effect of this inhibition on mouse ESCs from early embryonic SBs remains obscure.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION\nWe used 155 cleavage-stage mouse embryos to optimize the culture conditions for blastocyst development. Then, to assess the effects of R2i and 2i on ESC generation from SBs, we cultured isolated SBs in 2i and R2i for 10 days. SBs were replated under the same conditions to produce ESCs. In total, 46 embryos and 321 SBs from two- to eight-cell stages were recovered from NMRI and BALB/c mouse strains and used in this study.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS\nBlastomeres from 2- to 8-cell stage mouse embryos were dispersed and individually seeded into a 96-well plates that included mitotically inactivated feeder cells. ESCs were generated in B27N2 de\ufb01ned medium supplemented with R2i or 2i. Randomly selected ESC lines, generated from SBs of each stage, were assessed for pluripotency and germ-line transmission.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE\nWe demonstrated that dual inhibition of ERK1/2 and TGF\u03b2 (R2i) enhanced efficient blastocyst development and efficient establishment of ESCs from SB of 2- to 8-cell stage mouse embryos compared with the dual inhibition of ERK1/2 and GSK3 (2i) regardless of the embryonic stage and strain of mice. The proportions of SBs that produced ESC were 50-60 versus 20-30%.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\nThis study was done with mouse embryos, it is not known whether these findings are transferable to humans.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\nThese findings resulted in an increased efficiency of ESC generation from one biopsied blastomere for autogeneic or allogeneic matched pluripotent cells without the need to destroy viable embryos. The results also provided information about the developmental capacity of early embryonic blastomeres.\n\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS\nThis study was funded by grants provided from Royan Institute, the Iranian Council of Stem Cell Research and Technology and the Iran National Science Foundation. The authors have no con\ufb02ict of interest to declare.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that reduced focal adhesion enabled mESCs to be maintained in an undifferentiated and pluripotent state. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be maintained in a pluripotent state when cultured with 2 inhibitors (2i) of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), and Royan 2 inhibitors (R2i) of FGF4 and TGF\u03b2. The molecular mechanisms that control ESC self-renewal and pluripotency are more important for translating stem cell technologies to clinical applications. In this study, we used the shotgun proteomics technique to compare the proteome of the ground state condition (R2i- and 2i-grown cells) to that of serum. Out of 1749 proteins identified, 171 proteins were differentially expressed (p < 0.05) in the 2i, R2i, and serum samples. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially abundant proteins showed that the focal adhesion signaling pathway significantly down-regulated under ground state conditions. mESCs had highly adhesive attachment under the serum condition, whereas in the 2i and R2i culture conditions, a loss of adhesion was observed and the cells were rounded and grew in compact colonies on gelatin. Quantitative RT-PCR showed reduced expression of the integrins family in the 2i and R2i conditions. The serum culture had more prominent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) compared to 2i and R2i cultures. Activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 decreased in the 2i and R2i cultures compared to serum. Activation of integrins by Mn2+ in the 2i and R2i cultures resulted in reduced Nanog and increased the expression of lineage marker genes. In this study, we demonstrated that reduced focal adhesion enabled mESCs to be maintained in an undifferentiated and pluripotent state.",

Significance: Our study reveals a novel function of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the generation of PSCs. Mouse pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), such as ES cells and induced PSCs (iPSCs), are an excellent system to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in early embryonic development. The signaling pathways orchestrated by leukemia inhibitor factor/STAT3, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, and FGF/MEK/ERK play key roles in the generation of pluripotency. However, the function of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in this process remains elusive. Here we show that inhibiting TGF-\u03b2 signaling with its inhibitor SB431542 can substitute for Oct4 during reprogramming. Moreover, inhibiting TGF-\u03b2 signaling can sustain the pluripotency of iPSCs and ES cells through modulating FGF/MEK/ERK signaling.

Primordial germ cells (PGCs) have the ability to be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state and are defined as embryonic germ cells (EGCs) in vitro. EGC formation is more efficient, has a shorter culture period than somatic cell reprogramming, and does not require exogenous genetic manipulation. Therefore, EGCs are a good model to analyze mechanisms by which committed cells acquire a pluripotent state. In the present study we have attempted to elucidate a more defined and robust protocol that promotes EGC generation through the suppression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways by SB431542 (SB) and PD0325901 (PD), respectively. Under this condition the efficiency of transformation of PGCs into EGCs was more than the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and ERK signaling pathways. Pluripotency of the resultant-derived EGC lines were further confirmed by gene expression, immunofluorescent staining, directed differentiation ability, teratoma formation, and their contribution to chimeric mice and germ-line transmission. These results showed that PGCs from different embryonic stages (E8.5 and E12.5) could be reprogrammed, maintained, and expanded efficiently under feeder- and serum-free chemically defined conditions by dual inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and ERK signaling pathways, regardless of the animal's genetic background.",

Background: Stem cells are believed as the premier hope to regenerate the defected tissues. In this regard, enhancing the efficient derivation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, as the best model of pluripotent stem cell, facilitates capturing of the efficient derivation of human ES cells. Small molecules play a critical role in improving the efficiency of generating the pluripotent stem cells by inhibiting signaling pathways related to differentiation. This study aimed to evaluate the role of some molecular signaling pathways (e.g. JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, WNT/GSK3 and TGF-I\u00b2) in the cells involved in producing and maintaining ES cells.Materials and Methods: In this review study, the relevant articles to signaling pathways and embryonic stem cells were selected from PubMed database. In addition, the procedure for the efficient derivation of mouse ES cells was analyzed using small molecules under different conditions, like 2i and R2i culture. Results: The R2i culture condition increases the efficiency of generation and maintenance of ES cell lines from different types of mouse strain. Thus, findings showed that by inhibiting the MEK and TGF-I\u00b2 pathways in this process, the higher frequency of cells would be maintained at ground state of pluripotency with no differentiation.

Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) isolated in vitro from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced PSC (iPSC) and also post-implantation epiblast-derived stem cells (EpiSCs) are known for their two unique characteristics: the ability to give rise to all somatic lineages and the self-renewal capacity. Numerous intrinsic signaling pathways contribute to the maintenance of the pluripotency state of stem cells by tightly controlling key transcriptional regulators of stemness including sex determining region Y box 2 (Sox-2), octamer-binding transcription factor (Oct)3/4, krueppel-like factor 4 (Klf-4), Nanog, and c-Myc. Signaling by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is of critical importance in regulating stem cells pluripotency. The FGF family is comprised of 22 ligands that interact with four FGF receptors (FGFRs). FGF/FGFR signaling governs fundamental cellular processes such as cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, embryonic development, organogenesis, tissue repair/regeneration, and metabolism. FGF signaling is mediated by the activation of RAS \u2013 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT, Phospholipase C Gamma (PLC\u03b3), and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), which intersects and synergizes with other signaling pathways such as Wnt, retinoic acid (RA) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 signaling. In the current review, we summarize the role of FGF signaling in the maintenance of pluripotency state of stem cells through regulation of key transcriptional factors.",

        "abstract": "Recently emerging evidence that dual inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways plays an important role in regulating pluripotency in both rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cells is discussed. Stem cells are unspecialized cells and excellent model in developmental biology and a promising approach to the treatment of disease and injury. In the last 30 years, pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells were established from murine and primate sources, and display indefinite replicative potential and the ability to differentiate to all three embryonic germ layers. Despite large efforts in many aspects of rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cell culture, a number of diverse challenges remain. Natural and synthetic small molecules (SMs) strategy has the potential to overcome these hurdles. Small molecules are typically fast and reversible that target specific signaling pathways, epigenetic processes and other cellular processes. Inhibition of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2/Smad) and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4)/ERK signaling pathways by SB431542 and PD0325901 small molecules, respectively, known as R2i, enhances the efficiency of mouse, rat, and chicken pluripotent stem cells passaging from different genetic backgrounds. Therefore, the application of SM inhibitors of TGF-\u03b2 and ERK1/2 with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) allow the cultivation of pluripotent stem cells in a chemically defined condition. In this review, we discuss recently emerging evidence that dual inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways plays an important role in regulating pluripotency in both rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cells.",

        "abstract": "Although Wnt5A could not promote na\u00efve hESC derivation, it was found that it was sustaining the conversion of established hESCs toward a more na\u00efve state, by interfering with various key signaling pathways. In mice, inhibition of both the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MEK/Erk) and the Wnt signaling inhibitor glycogen synthase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) enables the derivation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) from nonpermissive strains in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Whereas mESCs are in an uncommitted na\u00efve state, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) represent a more advanced state, denoted as primed pluripotency. This burdens hESCs with a series of characteristics, which, in contrast to na\u00efve ESCs, makes them not ideal for key applications such as cell-based clinical therapies and human disease modeling. In this study, different small molecule combinations were applied during human ESC derivation. Hereby, we aimed to sustain the na\u00efve pluripotent state, by interfering with various key signaling pathways. First, we tested several combinations on existing, 2i (PD0325901 and CHIR99021)-derived mESCs. All combinations were shown to be equally adequate to sustain the expression of na\u00efve pluripotency markers. Second, these conditions were tested during hESC derivation. Overall, the best results were observed in the presence of medium supplemented with 2i, LIF, and the noncanonical Wnt signaling agonist Wnt5A, alone and combined with epinephrine. In these conditions, outgrowths repeatedly showed an ESC progenitor-like morphology, starting from day 3. Culturing these \"progenitor cells\" did not result in stable, na\u00efve hESC lines in the current conditions. Although Wnt5A could not promote na\u00efve hESC derivation, we found that it was sustaining the conversion of established hESCs toward a more na\u00efve state. Future work should aim to distinct the effects of the various culture formulations, including our Wnt5A-supplemented medium, reported to promote stable na\u00efve pluripotency in hESCs.",

Porcine pluripotent stem cells had been derived from different culture systems. PeNK6 is a porcine pluripotent stem cell line that we established from an E5.5 embryo in a defined culture system. Signaling pathways related with pluripotency had been assessed in this cell line, and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway\u2013related genes were found upregulated significantly. In this study, we elucidated the role of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway in PeNK6 through adding small molecule inhibitors, SB431542 (KOSB) or A83-01 (KOA), into the original culture medium (KO) and analyzing the expression and activity of key factors involved in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. In KOSB/KOA medium, the morphology of PeNK6 became compact and the nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio was increased. The expression of the core transcription factor SOX2 was significantly upregulated compared with cell lines in the control KO medium, and the differentiation potential became balanced among three germ layers rather than bias to neuroectoderm/endoderm as the original PeNK6 did. The results indicated that inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 has positive effects on the porcine pluripotency. Based on these results, we established a pluripotent cell line (PeWKSB) from E5.5 blastocyst by employing TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors, and the cell line showed improved pluripotency.",

Objective: In vitro production of a definitive endoderm (DE) is an important issue in stem cell-related differentiation studies and it can assist with the production of more efficient endoderm derivatives for therapeutic applications. Despite tremendous progress in DE differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), researchers have yet to discover universal, efficient and cost-effective protocols. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we have treated hESCs with 200 nM of Stauprimide (Spd) for one day followed by activin A (50 ng/ml; A50) for the next three days (Spd- A50). In the positive control group, hESCs were treated with Wnt3a (25 ng/ml) and activin A (100 ng/ml) for the first day followed by activin A for the next three days (100 ng/ml; W/A100-A100). Results: Gene expression analysis showed up regulation of DE-specific marker genes (SOX17, FOXA2 and CXCR4) comparable to that observed in the positive control group. Expression of the other lineage specific markers did not significantly change (p<0.05). We also obtained the same gene expression results using another hESC line. The use of higher concentrations of Spd (400 and 800 nM) in the Spd-A50 protocol caused an increase in the expression SOX17 as well as a dramatic increase in mortality rate of the hESCs. A lower concentration of activin A (25 ng/ml) was not able to up regulate the DE-specific marker genes. Then, A50 was replaced by inducers of definitive endoderm; IDE1/2 (IDE1 and IDE2), two previously reported small molecule (SM) inducers of DE, in our protocol (Spd-IDE1/2). This replacement resulted in the up regulation of visceral endoderm (VE) marker (SOX7) but not DE-specific markers. Therefore, while the Spd-A50 protocol led to DE production, we have shown that IDE1/2 could not fully replace activin A in DE induction of hESCs. Conclusion: These findings can assist with the design of more efficient chemically-defined protocols for DE induction of hESCs and lead to a better understanding of the different signaling networks that are involved in DE differentiation of hESCs.",

Definitive endoderm (DE) is the first stage of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation into hepatocyte\u2010like cells. Developing human liver cell models for pharmaceutical applications is highly demanding. Due to the vast number of existing protocols to generate DE cells from hPSCs, we aimed to compare the specificity and efficiency of selected published differentiation conditions. We differentiated two hPSC lines (induced PSC and embryonic stem cell) to DE cells on Matrigel matrix using growth factors (Activin A and Wnt\u20103a) and small molecules (sodium butyrate and IDE 1) in different combinations. By studying dynamic changes during 6 days in cell morphology and the expression of markers for pluripotency, DE, and other germ layer lineages, we found that Activin A is essential for DE differentiation, while Wnt\u20103a and sodium butyrate are dispensable. Although sodium butyrate exerted rapid DE differentiation kinetics, it caused massive cell death and could not generate sufficient cells for further differentiation and applications. We further discover that IDE 1 could not induce DE as reported previously. Hereby, we compared different conditions for DE induction and found an effective six day\u2010protocol to obtain DE cells for the further differentiation and applications.",

Dynamic suspension culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in stirred bioreactors provides a valuable scalable culture platform for integrated differentiation toward different lineages for potential research and therapeutic applications. However, current protocols for scalable and integrated differentiation of hPSCs limited due to high cost of growth factors and technical challenges. Here, hPSCs aggregates primed with 6 and 12\u2009\u03bcM of CHIR99021 (CHIR), a Wnt agonist, in combination with different concentrations of high cost Activin A (10, 25, 50, 100\u2009ng/mL). We sought to determine the appropriate treatment duration for efficient and cost-effective differentiation protocol for foregut definitive endoderm production in a dynamic suspension culture. Afterward, we evaluated the impact of the initial hPSC aggregate sizes (small: 86\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u2009\u03bcm; medium: 142\u2009\u00b1\u200932\u2009\u03bcm; large: 214\u2009\u00b1\u200934\u2009\u03bcm) as critical bioprocess parameter on differentiation efficacy at the beginning of induction. The results indicated that 1-day priming of hPSCs as 3D aggregates (hPSpheres) with 6\u2009\u03bcM CHIR followed by treatment with a low concentration of Activin (10\u2009ng/mL) for 2 days resulted in efficient differentiation to definitive endoderm. This finding confirmed by the presence of \u226570% SOX17/FOXA2-double positive cells that highly expressed the anterior endodermal marker HEX. These endodermal cells differentiated efficiently into mature functional hepatocytes [60% albumin (ALB)-positive cells]. The results showed that the initial size of hPSC aggregates significantly impacted on the efficacy of differentiation. The medium sized-hPSpheres resulted in higher productivity and differentiation efficiency for scalable hepatocytes production, whereas small aggregates resulted in significant cell-loss after CHIR treatment and large aggregates had less efficacious endodermal differentiation. Differentiated cells exhibited multiple characteristics of primary hepatocytes as evidenced by expressions of liver-specific markers, indocyanine green and low-density lipoprotein uptake, and glycogen storage. Thus, this platform could be employed for scalable production of hPSC-derived hepatocytes for clinical and drug discovery applications.",

Objective The ability to generate lung alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) enables the study of lung development, regenerative medicine, and modeling of lung diseases. The establishment of defined, scalable differentiation methods is a step toward this goal. This study intends to investigate the competency of small molecule induced mouse embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm (mESC-DE) cells towards ATII cells. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, we designed a two-step differentiation protocol. mESC line Royan B20 (RB20) was induced to differentiate into DE (6 days) and then into ATII cells (9 days) by using an adherent culture method. To induce differentiation, we treated the mESCs for 6 days in serum-free differentiation (SFD) media and induced them with 200 nM small molecule inducer of definitive endoderm 2 (IDE2). For days 7-15 (9 days) of induction, we treated the resultant DE cells with new differentiation media comprised of 100 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) (group F), 0.5 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone (group H), and A549 conditioned medium (A549 CM) (group CM) in SFD media. Seven different combinations of factors were tested to assess the efficiencies of these factors to promote differentiation. The expressions of DE- and ATII-specific markers were investigated during each differentiation step. Results Although both F and H (alone and in combination) promoted differentiation through ATII-like cells, the highest percentage of surfactant protein C (SP-C) expressing cells (~37%) were produced in DE-like cells treated by F+H+CM. Ultrastructural analyses also confirmed the presence of lamellar bodies (LB) in the ATII-like cells. Conclusion These results suggest that hydrocortisone can be a promoting factor in alveolar fate differentiation of IDE2- induced mESC-DE cells. These cells have potential for drug screening and cell-replacement therapies.",

        "abstract": "It is found that Fasudil or IDE1 alone could not achieve a similar effect as activin A, but on the contrary, CHIR99021 could efficiently promote definitive endoderm differentiation. Abstract Small molecules such as ROCK inhibitors (Fasudil) and inducer of definitive endoderm 1 (IDE1) can promote differentiation of definitive endoderm, but their effects remain controversial. Therefore, we attempted to verify the effect of these small molecules on promoting definitive endoderm differentiation and found that Fasudil or IDE1 alone could not achieve a similar effect as activin A. On the contrary, CHIR99021 could efficiently promote definitive endoderm differentiation. Nearly 43.4% of experimental cells were SRY-box transcription factor 17 (SOX17)-positive under the synergistic effect of IDE1 and CHIR99021, but its ability to differentiate towards definitive endoderm was still insufficient. Transcriptional analysis and comparison of IDE1 and CHIR99021 synergistic groups (IC) and activin A and CHIR99021 synergistic groups (AC) showed significantly down-regulated definitive endoderm markers in the IC group compared with those in the AC group and the differences between the two groups were mainly due to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP4) and fibroblast growth factor 17 (FGF17). Further single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed lower expression of BMP4 in SOX17-positive populations, while mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD) protein translation signal and FGF17 in the AC group were higher than that in the IC group. Western blot analysis showed a significant difference in levels of p-SMAD2/3 between AC and IC groups, which suggests that regulating p-SMAD2/3 may provide a reference to improve the differentiation of definitive endoderm.",

Definitive endoderm (DE) is a vital precursor for internal organs such as liver and pancreas. Efficient protocol to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to DE is essential for regenerative medicine and for modeling diseases; yet, poor cell survival during DE differentiation remains unsolved. In this study, our use of B27 supplement in modified differentiation protocols has led to a substantial improvement. We used an SOX17-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter hESC line to compare and modify established DE differentiation protocols. Both total live cell numbers and the percentages of eGFP-positive cells were used to assess differentiation efficiency. Among tested protocols, three modified protocols with serum-free B27 supplement were developed to generate a high number of DE cells. Massive cell death was avoided during DE differentiation and the percentage of DE cells remained high. When the resulting DE cells were further differentiated toward the pancreatic lineage, the expression of pancreatic-specific markers was significantly increased. Similar high DE differentiation efficiency was observed in H1\u2009hESCs and iPSCs through the modified protocols. In B27 components, bovine serum albumin was found to facilitate DE differentiation and cell survival. Using our modified DE differentiation protocols, satisfactory quantities of quality DE can be produced as primary material for further endoderm lineage differentiation.",

Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) generated in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an invaluable resource for basic research, regenerative medicine, drug screening, toxicology, and modeling of liver disease and development. This unit describes a small-molecule-driven protocol for in vitro differentiation of hPSCs into HLCs without the use of growth factors. hPSCs are coaxed through a developmentally relevant route via the primitive streak to definitive endoderm (DE) using the small molecule CHIR99021 (a Wnt agonist), replacing the conventional growth factors Wnt3A and activin A. The small-molecule-derived DE is then differentiated to hepatoblast-like cells in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. The resulting hepatoblasts are then differentiated to HLCs with N-hexanoic-Tyr, Ile-6 aminohexanoic amide (Dihexa, a hepatocyte growth factor agonist) and dexamethasone. The protocol provides an efficient and reproducible procedure for differentiation of hPSCs into HLCs utilizing small molecules. \u00a9 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Background Various methods have been developed to generate hepatic cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that rely on the combined use of multiple expensive growth factors, limiting industrial-scale production and widespread applications. Small molecules offer an attractive alternative to growth factors for producing hepatic cells since they are more economical and relatively stable. Methods We dissect small-molecule combinations and identify the ideal cocktails to achieve an optimally efficient and cost-effective strategy for hepatic cells differentiation, expansion, and maturation. Results We demonstrated that small-molecule cocktail CIP (including CHIR99021, IDE1, and PD0332991) efficiently induced definitive endoderm (DE) formation via increased endogenous TGF-\u03b2/Nodal signaling. Furthermore, we identified that combining Vitamin C, Dihexa, and Forskolin (VDF) could substitute growth factors to induce hepatic specification. The obtained hepatoblasts (HBs) could subsequently expand and mature into functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) by the established chemical formulas. Thus, we established a stepwise strategy with complete small molecules for efficiently producing scalable HBs and functionally matured HLCs. The small-molecule-derived HLCs displayed typical functional characteristics as mature hepatocytes in vitro and repopulating injured liver in vivo.

Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this review is to provide an updated perspective on directing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to hepatocyte-like-cells (HLCs) and the associated challenges.Recent FindingsRecent advances in the hepatocyte differentiation field have largely been focused on increasing the reproducibility and definition of culture systems to further their translation to a clinical setting. There have been advances using new extracellular matrices such as human laminins, and recent work using small molecules to drive the differentiation process has dramatically reduced the cost of producing HLCs with equivalent phenotypes to growth factor-derived cells.SummaryThere are still several key aspects that remain unresolved, including the immature phenotype of hPSC-derived HLCs (a major hurdle for hPSC-derived progeny). Another key question is the zonal identity of the HLCs produced in vitro, which will have major implications in terms of disease modeling and drug metabolism. To date, there has been little investigation of this aspect of hepatic biology reported in the field.",

        "abstract": "It is proved that GTED is NP-complete and shown that the ILPs proposed do not solve GTED and are not solvable in polynomial time, providing solid algorithmic foundations for comparing genome graphs and point to the direction of heuristics. The graph traversal edit distance (GTED), introduced by Ebrahimpour Boroojeny et al. (2018), is an elegant distance measure defined as the minimum edit distance between strings reconstructed from Eulerian trails in two edge-labeled graphs. GTED can be used to infer evolutionary relationships between species by comparing de Bruijn graphs directly without the computationally costly and error-prone process of genome assembly. Ebrahimpour Boroojeny et al. (2018) propose two ILP formulations for GTED and claim that GTED is polynomially solvable because the linear programming relaxation of one of the ILPs always yields optimal integer solutions. The claim that GTED is polynomially solvable is contradictory to the complexity results of existing string-to-graph matching problems. We resolve this conflict in complexity results by proving that GTED is NP-complete and showing that the ILPs proposed by Ebrahimpour Boroojeny et al. do not solve GTED but instead solve for a lower bound of GTED and are not solvable in polynomial time. In addition, we provide the first two, correct ILP formulations of GTED and evaluate their empirical efficiency. These results provide solid algorithmic foundations for comparing genome graphs and point to the direction of heuristics.",

        "abstract": "The notion of string set universe diameter of a genome graph is introduced and it is shown that the diameter-corrected FGTED reduces the average deviation of the estimated distance from the true string set distances by more than 250%. Motivation Intra-sample heterogeneity describes the phenomenon where a genomic sample contains a diverse set of genomic sequences. In practice, the true string sets in a sample are often unknown due to limitations in sequencing technology. In order to compare heterogeneous samples, genome graphs can be used to represent such sets of strings. However, a genome graph is generally able to represent a string set universe that contains multiple sets of strings in addition to the true string set. This difference between genome graphs and string sets is not well characterized. As a result, a distance metric between genome graphs may not match the distance between true string sets. Results We extend a genome graph distance metric, Graph Traversal Edit Distance (GTED) proposed by Ebrahimpour Boroojeny et al., to FGTED to model the distance between heterogeneous string sets and show that GTED and FGTED always underestimate the Earth Mover\u2019s Edit Distance (EMED) between string sets. We introduce the notion of string set universe diameter of a genome graph. Using the diameter, we are able to upper-bound the deviation of FGTED from EMED and to improve FGTED so that it reduces the average error in empirically estimating the similarity between true string sets. On simulated TCR sequences and Hepatitis B virus genomes, we show that the diameter-corrected FGTED reduces the average deviation of the estimated distance from the true string set distances by more than 250%.

Background Opportunely screening for diabetes is crucial to reduce its related morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic burden. Machine learning (ML) has excellent capability to maximize predictive accuracy. We aim to develop ML-augmented models for diabetes screening in community and primary care settings. Methods 8425 participants were involved from a population-based study in Hubei, China since 2011. The dataset was split into a development set and a testing set. Seven different ML algorithms were compared to generate predictive models. Non-laboratory features were employed in the ML model for community settings, and laboratory test features were further introduced in the ML+lab models for primary care. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (auPR), and the average detection costs per participant of these models were compared with their counterparts based on the New China Diabetes Risk Score (NCDRS) currently recommended for diabetes screening. Results The AUC and auPR of the ML model were 0\u00b7697and 0\u00b7303 in the testing set, seemingly outperforming those of NCDRS by 10\u00b799% and 64\u00b767%, respectively. The average detection cost of the ML model was 12\u00b781% lower than that of NCDRS with the same sensitivity (0\u00b772). Moreover, the average detection cost of the ML+FPG model is the lowest among the ML+lab models and less than that of the ML model and NCDRS+FPG model. Conclusion The ML model and the ML+FPG model achieved higher predictive accuracy and lower detection costs than their counterpart based on NCDRS. Thus, the ML-augmented algorithm is potential to be employed for diabetes screening in community and primary care settings.",

Data mining algorithms are facing the challenge to deal with an increasing number of complex objects. For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite. In experiments on classification of graph models of proteins, our shortest-path kernels show significantly higher classification accuracy than walk-based kernels.",

(2006) yet provably positive semi-definite is provided. We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which include the random walk (Gartner et al., 2003; Borgwardt et al., 2005) and marginalized (Kashima et al., 2003, 2004; Mahet al., 2004) graph kernels. Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the time complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with n vertices from O(n6) to O(n3). We find a spectral decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point methods that take O(dn3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge kernels, and O(n4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O(n2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels (Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a kernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of kernel of Frohlich et al. (2006) yet provably positive semi-definite.",

In this article, we propose a family of efficient kernels for large graphs with discrete node labels. Key to our method is a rapid feature extraction scheme based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman test of isomorphism on graphs. It maps the original graph to a sequence of graphs, whose node attributes capture topological and label information. A family of kernels can be defined based on this Weisfeiler-Lehman sequence of graphs, including a highly efficient kernel comparing subtree-like patterns. Its runtime scales only linearly in the number of edges of the graphs and the length of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph sequence. In our experimental evaluation, our kernels outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on several graph classification benchmark data sets in terms of accuracy and runtime. Our kernels open the door to large-scale applications of graph kernels in various disciplines such as computational biology and social network analysis.",

We present a new approach that combines sequential, structural and chemical information into one graph model of proteins. We predict functional class membership of enzymes and non-enzymes using graph kernels and support vector machine classification on these protein graphs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur graph model, derivable from protein sequence and structure only, is competitive with vector models that require additional protein information, such as the size of surface pockets. If we include this extra information into our graph model, our classifier yields significantly higher accuracy levels than the vector models. Hyperkernels allow us to select and to optimally combine the most relevant node attributes in our protein graphs. We have laid the foundation for a protein function prediction system that integrates protein information from various sources efficiently and effectively.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nMore information available via www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Mitarbeiter/borgwardt.html.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that enhancers tend to play roles in stem cell differentiation and expression levels of the genes they control correlate with cell-to-cell variation, and differences of DNA methylation between these marks can only be explained by cellular heterogeneity. In mammals, cellular identity is defined through strict regulation of chromatin modifications and DNA methylation that control gene expression. Methylation of cytosines at CpG sites in the genome is mainly associated with suppression; however, the reason for enhancer-specific methylation is not fully understood. We used sequential ChIP-bisulfite-sequencing for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac histone marks. By collecting data from the same genomic region, we identified enhancers differentially methylated between these two marks. We observed a global gain of CpG methylation primarily in H3K4me1-marked nucleosomes during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation. This gain occurred largely in enhancer regions that regulate genes critical for differentiation. The higher levels of DNA methylation in H3K4me1-versus H3K27ac-marked enhancers, despite it being the same genomic region, indicates cellular heterogeneity of enhancer states. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq profiles demonstrated that this heterogeneity correlates with gene expression during differentiation. Furthermore, heterogeneity of enhancer methylation correlates with transcription start site methylation. Our results provide insights into enhancer-based functional variation in complex biological systems. Author summary Cellular dynamics are underlined by numerous regulatory layers. The regulatory mechanism of interest in this work are enhancers. Enhancers are regulatory regions responsible, mainly, for increasing the possibility of transcription of a certain gene. Enhancers are marked by two distinct chemical groups-H3K4me1 and H3K27ac on the tail of histones. Histones are the proteins responsible for DNA packaging into condensed chromatin structure. In contrast, DNA methylation is a chemical modification often found on enhancers, and is traditionally associated with repression. A long debated question revolves around the functional relevance of DNA methylation in the context of enhancers. Here, we combined the two regulatory layers, histone marks and DNA methylation, to a single measurement that can highlight DNA methylation separately on each histone mark but at the same genomic region. When isolated with H3K4me1, enhancers showed higher levels of methylation compared to H3K27ac. As we measured the same genomic locations, we show that differences of DNA methylation between these marks can only be explained by cellular heterogeneity. We also demonstrated that these enhancers tend to play roles in stem cell differentiation and expression levels of the genes they control correlate with cell-to-cell variation.",

Background DNA hypermethylation at promoter CpG islands (CGIs) is a hallmark of cancers and could lead to dysregulation of gene expression in the development of cancers, however, its dynamics and regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Bivalent genes, that direct development and differentiation of stem cells, are found to be frequent targets of hypermethylation in cancers. Results Here we performed comprehensive analysis across multiple cancer types and identified that the decrease in H3K4me1 levels coincides with DNA hypermethylation at the bivalent promoter CGIs during tumorigenesis. Removal of DNA hypermethylation leads to increment of H3K4me1 at promoter CGIs with preference for bivalent genes. Nevertheless, the alteration of H3K4me1 by overexpressing or knockout LSD1, the demethylase of H3K4, doesn\u2019t change the level or pattern of DNA methylation. Moreover, LSD1 was found to regulate the expression of a bivalent gene OVOL2 to promote tumorigenesis. Knockdown of OVOL2 in LSD1 knockout HCT116 cells restored the cancer cell phenotype. Conclusion In summary, our work identified a universal indicator that can pre-mark DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells, and dissected the interplay between H3K4me1 and DNA hypermethylation in detail. Current study also reveals a novel mechanism underlying the oncogenic role of LSD1, providing clues for cancer therapies.",

        "abstract": "The characterization of the aberrant enhancer DNA methylation provides not only a novel pathogenic mechanism for different tumors but also highlights novel potential therapeutic targets for myeloid derived neoplasms. Gene regulation through DNA methylation is a well described phenomenon that has a prominent role in physiological and pathological cell-states. This epigenetic modification is usually grouped in regions denominated CpG islands, which frequently co-localize with gene promoters, silencing the transcription of those genes. Recent genome-wide DNA methylation studies have challenged this paradigm, demonstrating that DNA methylation of regulatory regions outside promoters is able to influence cell-type specific gene expression programs under physiologic or pathologic conditions. Coupling genome-wide DNA methylation assays with histone mark annotation has allowed for the identification of specific epigenomic changes that affect enhancer regulatory regions, revealing an additional layer of complexity to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In this review, we summarize the novel evidence for the molecular and biological regulation of DNA methylation in enhancer regions and the dynamism of these changes contributing to the fine-tuning of gene expression. We also analyze the contribution of enhancer DNA methylation on the expression of relevant genes in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. The characterization of the aberrant enhancer DNA methylation provides not only a novel pathogenic mechanism for different tumors but also highlights novel potential therapeutic targets for myeloid derived neoplasms.",

        "abstract": "The DNA methylation profile of myelofibrosis is described, identifying extensive changes in enhancer elements and revealing ZFP36L1 as a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene. In this study we interrogated the DNA methylome of myelofibrosis patients using high-density DNA methylation arrays. We detected 35,215 differentially methylated CpG, corresponding to 10,253 genes, between myelofibrosis patients and healthy controls. These changes were present both in primary and secondary myelofibrosis, which showed no differences between them. Remarkably, most differentially methylated CpG were located outside gene promoter regions and showed significant association with enhancer regions. This aberrant enhancer hypermethylation was negatively correlated with the expression of 27 genes in the myelofibrosis cohort. Of these, we focused on the ZFP36L1 gene and validated its decreased expression and enhancer DNA hypermethylation in an independent cohort of patients and myeloid cell-lines. In vitro reporter assay and 5\u2019-azacitidine treatment confirmed the functional relevance of hyper-methylation of ZFP36L1 enhancer. Furthermore, in vitro rescue of ZFP36L1 expression had an impact on cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in SET-2 cell line indicating a possible role of ZFP36L1 as a tumor suppressor gene in myelofibrosis. Collectively, we describe the DNA methylation profile of myelofibrosis, identifying extensive changes in enhancer elements and revealing ZFP36L1 as a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene.",

        "abstract": "The results show that H3K4me1, in the absence of H3k4me3, supports transcription of the HIS3 gene and expression of one or more of the genes required for biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine during nutrient stress. Mono-methylation of the fourth lysine on the N-terminal tail of histone H3 was found to support the induction of RNA polymerase II transcription in S. cerevisiae during nutrient stress. In S. cerevisiae , the mono-, di- and tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) is catalyzed by the protein methyltransferase, Set1. The three distinct methyl marks on H3K4 act in discrete ways to regulate transcription. Nucleosomes enriched with tri-methylated H3K4 are usually associated with active transcription whereas di-methylated H3K4 is associated with gene repression. Mono-methylated H3K4 has been shown to repress gene expression in S. cerevisiae and is detected at enhancers and promoters in eukaryotes. S. cerevisiae set1\u0394 mutants unable to methylate H3K4 exhibit growth defects during histidine starvation. The growth defects are rescued by either a wild-type allele of SET1 or partial-function alleles of set1 , including a mutant that predominantly generates H3K4me1 and not H3K4me3. Rescue of the growth defect is associated with induction of the HIS3 gene. Growth defects observed when set1\u0394 cultures were starved for isoleucine and valine were also rescued by wild-type SET1 or partial-function set1 alleles. The results show that H3K4me1, in the absence of H3K4me3, supports transcription of the HIS3 gene and expression of one or more of the genes required for biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine during nutrient stress. Set1-like methyltransferases are evolutionarily conserved, and research has linked their functions to developmental gene regulation and several cancers in higher eukaryotes. Identification of mechanisms of H3K4me1-mediated activation of transcription in budding yeast will provide insight into gene regulation in all eukaryotes.",

Epigenetic mechanisms are known to regulate gene expression during chondrogenesis. In this study, we have characterised the epigenome during in vitro differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into chondrocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to assess a range of N-terminal post-transcriptional modifications (marks) to histone H3 lysines (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3) in both hMSCs and differentiated chondrocytes. Chromatin states were characterised using histone ChIP-seq and cis-regulatory elements were identified in chondrocytes. Chondrocyte enhancers were associated with chondrogenesis related gene ontology (GO) terms. In silico analysis and integration of DNA methylation data with chondrogenesis chromatin states revealed that enhancers marked by histone marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were de-methylated during in vitro chondrogenesis. Similarity analysis between hMSC and chondrocyte chromatin states defined in this study with epigenomes of cell-types defined by the Roadmap Epigenomics project revealed that enhancers are more distinct between cell-types compared to other chromatin states. Motif analysis revealed that the transcription factor SOX9 is enriched in chondrocyte enhancers. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that chondrocyte enhancers characterised in this study exhibited enhancer activity which may be modulated by inducing DNA methylation and SOX9 overexpression. Altogether, these integrated data illustrate the cross-talk between different epigenetic mechanisms during chondrocyte differentiation. Summary Human mesenchymal stem cells are able to differentiate into chondrocytes, the cell type found in cartilage, making them an accessible system to study gene regulation during this process. Epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and DNA methylation together with transcription factor binding play a role in activating and repressing gene expression. In this study, we investigated the genome-wide histone modification changes during chondrocyte differentiation. Integration of this data with DNA methylation and SOX9 transcription factor ChIP-seq revealed epigenetic changes at gene enhancer elements. Regions of the genome that transition from non-enhancers to enhancers in chondrocytes are enriched for SOX9 transcription factor binding sites. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that enhancer activity may be modulated by manipulating DNA methylation and SOX9 expression. This study has defined important regulatory elements in chondrocytes which could serve as targets for future mechanistic studies.",

Alterations to cellular and molecular programs with brain aging result in cognitive impairment and susceptibility to neurodegenerative disease. Changes in DNA methylation patterns, an epigenetic modification required for various CNS functions are observed with brain aging and can be prevented by anti-aging interventions, but the relationship of altered methylation to gene expression is poorly understood. Paired analysis of the hippocampal methylome and transcriptome with aging of male and female mice demonstrates that age-related differences in methylation and gene expression are anti-correlated within gene bodies and enhancers. Altered promoter methylation with aging was found to be generally un-related to altered gene expression. A more striking relationship was found between methylation levels at young age and differential gene expression with aging. Highly methylated gene bodies and promoters in early life were associated with age-related increases in gene expression even in the absence of significant methylation changes with aging. As well, low levels of methylation in early life were correlated to decreased expression with aging. This relationship was also observed in genes altered in two mouse Alzheimer\u2019s models. DNA methylation patterns established in youth, in combination with other epigenetic marks, were able to accurately predict changes in transcript trajectories with aging. These findings are consistent with the developmental origins of disease hypothesis and indicate that epigenetic variability in early life may explain differences in aging trajectories and age-related disease.",

DNA methylation and histone methylation are two types of the most important epigenetic modifications. However, research on their differential expression in gonads of male and female fish is limited. In this study, we examined the characteristics of DNA methylation and tri-methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) modification profiles in the gonads of the wild-type and meio-gynogenetic olive flounders Paralichthys olivaceus. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis revealed that the global DNA methylation level was higher in the testis than in the ovary. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) results indicated that maintenance DNA methyltransferase gene dnmt1 and de novo DNA methyltransferase gene dnmt3a are highly expressed in the ovary, while DNA demethyltransferase genes tets are highly expressed in the testis. The inconsistency of DNA methylation and methyltransferase genes in the gonads might associate with the differential distribution in the testis. 5-mC mainly located in the spermatids of the testis was shown with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furtherly, dnmt3a and tets are mainly located in spermatocytes and oocytes with in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. As for H3K4me3, total level is higher in the ovary detected with western blot assay. IHC results showed that the signals of H3K4me3 in Sertoli cells of the testis were stronger than those in spermatocytes and spermatids. Methyltransferase gene kmt2b and demethylase genes kdm5a and kdm5c also exhibit much higher expression in the testis with qPCR, and ISH stronger signals of kmt2b and kdm5s were detected in spermatocytes. These results implied that DNA methylation and H3K4me3 are involved in the flounder sex differences and gametogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The DDM1-directed TE silencing essentially preserves heterochromatic features and abolishes mobile threats to genome stability and is reviewed in the RdDM and non-RdDM contexts. Epigenetic modifications are indispensable for regulating gene bodies and TE silencing. DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1) is a chromatin remodeller involved in histone modifications and DNA methylation. Apart from maintaining the epigenome, DDM1 also maintains key plant traits such as flowering time and heterosis. The role of DDM1 in epigenetic regulation is best characterised in plants, especially arabidopsis, rice, maize and tomato. The epigenetic changes induced by DDM1 establish the stable inheritance of many plant traits for at least eight generations, yet DDM1 does not methylate protein-coding genes. The DDM1 TE silencing mechanism is distinct and has evolved independently of other silencing pathways. Unlike the RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway, DDM1 does not depend on siRNAs to enforce the heterochromatic state of TEs. Here, we review DDM1 TE silencing activity in the RdDM and non-RdDM contexts. The DDM1 TE silencing machinery is strongly associated with the histone linker H1 and histone H2A.W. While the linker histone H1 excludes the RdDM factors from methylating the heterochromatin, the histone H2A.W variant prevents TE mobility. The DDM1-H2A.W strategy alone silences nearly all the mobile TEs in the arabidopsis genome. Thus, the DDM1-directed TE silencing essentially preserves heterochromatic features and abolishes mobile threats to genome stability.",

The global infertility rate has been declining from year to year. PCOS is one of the treatable accountable causes contributing to anovulatory infertility. Nevertheless, the success rate of treatments and live-birth outcomes especially involving assisted reproductive techniques is still not very promising. There is a reduction in the development potential of oocytes and high-quality embryos in PCOS patients compared to non-PCOS patients. A critical step in IVF treatment is the assessment of oocyte and embryo competence before embryo transfer. Oocytes in metaphase II are very fragile. Repeated morphological assessment on these oocytes may directly impair the quality and affect the whole process. Identification of potential biomarkers especially in the cumulus cells oocytes complex will help to predict the outcome and may create space for improvement. This review has explored gene expression in cumulus cells with regards to oocytes quality in both normal and PCOS women. The gene expression was classified according to their physiological function such as the contribution on cumulus expansion, cumulus cells apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. Collectively, the review suggested that positive expression of HAS2, PTX3, GREM1, and VCAN may correlate with good quality oocytes and can be used as an indicator among PCOS women.",

Simple Summary The extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in many physiological processes that occur in the ovary and affect reproduction in animals and humans. The ECM has been shown to significantly affect folliculogenesis, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation. This is mainly due to the involvement of ECM in intercellular signaling. In the present study, we report the gene expression profile of porcine granulosa cells during their primary in vitro culture. The genes presented are related to ECM formation but also to cadherins and integrins that influence intercellular dialogue. During the study, it was shown that most of the genes were upregulated. A detailed understanding of the expression of genes such as POSTN, CHI3L1, CAV-1, IRS1, DCN in in vitro culture of granulosa cells may provide a basis for further studies on the molecular mechanisms occurring within the ovary. Knowledge of ECM-related gene expression within granulosa cells can also be used to study the recently discovered stemness of these cells. Moreover, the presented data may serve for the development of assisted reproduction techniques, which, especially in vitro, are becoming increasingly common. Abstract The extracellular matrix (ECM) in granulosa cells is functionally very important, and it is involved in many processes related to ovarian follicle growth and ovulation. The aim of this study was to describe the expression profile of genes within granulosa cells that are associated with extracellular matrix formation, intercellular signaling, and cell\u2013cell fusion. The material for this study was ovaries of sexually mature pigs obtained from a commercial slaughterhouse. Laboratory-derived granulosa cells (GCs) from ovarian follicles were cultured in a primary in vitro culture model. The extracted genetic material (0, 48, 96, and 144 h) were subjected to microarray expression analysis. Among 81 genes, 66 showed increased expression and only 15 showed decreased expression were assigned to 7 gene ontology groups \u201cextracellular matrix binding\u201d, \u201cextracellular matrix structural constituent\u201d, \u201cbinding, bridging\u201d, \u201ccadherin binding\u201d, \u201ccell adhesion molecule binding\u201d, \u201ccollagen binding\u201d and \u201ccadherin binding involved in cell-cell adhesion\u201d. The 10 genes with the highest expression (POSTN, ITGA2, FN1, LAMB1, ITGB3, CHI3L1, PCOLCE2, CAV1, DCN, COL14A1) and 10 of the most down-regulated (SPP1, IRS1, CNTLN, TMPO, PAICS, ANK2, ADAM23, ABI3BP, DNAJB1, IGF1) were selected for further analysis. The results were validated by RT-qPCR. The current results may serve as preliminary data for further analyses using in vitro granulosa cell cultures in assisted reproduction technologies, studies of pathological processes in the ovary as well as in the use of the stemness potential of GCs.",

Granulosa cells (GCs) surrounding oocytes are crucial for follicular growth, oocyte development, ovulation, and luteinization under the dynamic co-stimulation of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This study aimed to investigate the effect of LH levels on GCs in preovulatory follicles under gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist-based ovarian stimulation. In vitro experiments were also conducted to study the direct effect of LH on GCs. Twelve infertile women were divided into low (L), medium (M), and high (H) LH groups according to their serum LH levels during ovarian stimulation. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted to examine the transcriptome profiles of GCs obtained from the above patients during the oocyte retrieval. The activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase was measured under the stimulation of recombinant LH (rLH) concentration gradient combined with recombinant FSH. The ultrastructures of subcellular organelles were observed. Bioinformatic analyses showed that compared with the M group, molecule and pathway changes in the L group and in the H group were similar. In cultured GCs, both insufficient and excessive rLH impaired the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase. With the medium rLH concentration, numerous cell connections and abundant mitochondria and liposomes were observed. Compared with the medium concentration, GCs showed smaller and rounder mitochondria, more autophagosomes, and massive organelles damages with excessive rLH, and swollen, circular, or forked mitochondria were observed with inadequate rLH. RNA-seq provided a novel spectrum of transcriptome characteristics of GCs potentially affected by serum LH levels during ovarian stimulation. In vitro, rLH could directly affect GCs at the subcellular level.",

Remodeling of extracellular matrix in the womb facilitates the dramatic morphogenesis of maternal and placental tissues necessary to support fetal development. In addition to providing a scaffold to support tissue structure, extracellular matrix influences pregnancy outcomes by facilitating communication between cells and their microenvironment to regulate cellular adhesion, migration, and invasion. By reviewing the functions of extracellular matrix during key developmental milestones, including fertilization, embryo implantation, placental invasion, uterine growth, and labor, we illustrate the importance of extracellular matrix during healthy pregnancy and development. We also discuss how maladaptive matrix expression contributes to infertility and obstetric diseases such as implantation failure, preeclampsia, placenta accreta, and preterm birth. Recently, advances in engineering the biotic\u2013abiotic interface have potentiated the development of microphysiological systems, known as organs-on-chips, to represent human physiological and pathophysiological conditions in vitro. These technologies may offer new opportunities to study human fertility and provide a more granular understanding of the role of adaptive and maladaptive remodeling of the extracellular matrix during pregnancy. Impact statement Extracellular matrix in the womb regulates the initiation, progression, and completion of a healthy pregnancy. The composition and physical properties of extracellular matrix in the uterus and at the maternal\u2013fetal interface are remodeled at each gestational stage, while maladaptive matrix remodeling results in obstetric disease. As in vitro models of uterine and placental tissues, including micro-and milli-scale versions of these organs on chips, are developed to overcome the inherent limitations of studying human development in vivo, we can isolate the influence of cellular and extracellular components in healthy and pathological pregnancies. By understanding and recreating key aspects of the extracellular microenvironment at the maternal\u2013fetal interface, we can engineer microphysiological systems to improve assisted reproduction, obstetric disease treatment, and prenatal drug safety.",

Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a major endocrine and metabolic disorder with heterogeneous manifestations and complex etiology. As a leading cause of anovulatory infertility, the molecular diversity of the follicular microenvironment has not been fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the follicular fluid proteomic profiles of overweight/obese and normal-weight women with PCOS, to identify novel molecular mechanisms underlying PCOS and to determine the effect of obesity on the follicular fluid protein profiles. Methods: Follicular fluid samples were collected from 3 different groups: overweight/obese PCOS patients (n = 29), normal-weight PCOS patients (n = 29), and normo-ovulatory controls (n = 29). We used a quantitative approach with tandem mass tag labeling and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to identify the differentially expressed proteins. Differential abundance of four selected proteins was confirmed by ELISA. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was also conducted to further explore our findings. Furthermore, we compared the clinical, hormonal, and biochemical characteristics of overweight/obese and normal-weight patients with PCOS to determine the effects of obesity. Results: A total of 1,153 proteins were identified, of which 41 and 19 proteins were differentially expressed in the overweight/obese PCOS group vs. the control group, and in the normal-weight PCOS group vs. the control group, respectively. Bioinformatics analyses showed that the inflammatory, immunological, and metabolic-related biological processes were co-enriched in both subgroups of PCOS. Apolipoprotein A-II, complement C5, fetuin-B, and stromal cell-derived factor 1 were found to be involved in various processes and were validated using the ELISA analysis. From clinical features and proteomic data, obesity was found to worsen follicular development disturbances in PCOS. Conclusion: In this proteomic study, a panel of proteins were found differentially expressed in the follicular fluid of PCOS. Inflammatory, immunological, and metabolic abnormalities were identified inside the intra-follicular environment, which could be aggravated by obesity. The identified proteins were correlated with follicular growth and may be considered as candidate biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets of PCOS.",

Background & Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) is one of the most common causes of infertility due to anovulatory in women. The use of insulin-sensitizing agents was one of the treatments for this syndrome. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Metformin, Pioglitazone, Ripaglinide and Acarbose on histomorphological changes of polycystic ovaries. Materials & Methods : In this study, Polycystic ovaries were induced by injection of testosterone enanthate (TE) in immature female mice, for four weeks, then they had been divided into five groups; the control, Metformin, Pioglitazone, Repaglinide and Acarbose groups. Body weight, the ratio of ovary-to-animal weight, ovarian diameter, histomorphological changes of ovaries and characteristics of ovarian tissues were studied. Tukey test was used to calculate these parameters (P\u22640.05). Results : TE significantly increased the percentage of cystic Follicular and decreased follicular growth compared to treatment groups. The body weight, the ratio of ovary-to-animal weight and ovarian diameter, in all groups showed a significant decrease compared to the control group (p<0.05). In Metformin and Pioglitazone treated group, the number of degenerated oocytes, pyknotic-granlosa cells and vascularization were decreased and luteinization can be seen only in these groups. There is a significant reduction in mean growth of primordial, primary, pre-antral, cystic and atretic follicles in the treatment group. However, the mean number of pre-antral follicle showed a remarkable increase. The average number of antral follicles increased in metformin and pioglitazone groups (p<0.05). The results showed that Metformin and Pioglitazone groups cause a meaningful decrease in the ratio of ovary-to-animal weight (p<0.05). Conclusion : According to these results, Metformin and Pioglitazone have the same effects and can compensate for the damages due to PCOs. These drugs can develop follicular growth. Repaglinide can compensate for the damages in some cases, and, Acarbose has a negative effect on follicular growth.",

        "abstract": "It is pointed out that altered AGE deposition is a common feature in all PCOS phenotypes and further studies based on anti-AGE interventions could be helpful in creating innovative strategies for counteracting PCOS and its effects on fertility. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrine disorder in women in their reproductive age. In recent years, the role of AGEs (advanced glycation end products) in PCOS has gained great attention. AGEs are highly reactive molecules that can be assumed by diet or endogenously synthesized as by-products of metabolic processes. AGE deposition increases with aging, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and glycotoxin-rich diet. Therefore, it has become imperative to understand the underlying mechanism of AGEs actions and its downstream effects in PCOS pathophysiology. By integrating evidence from human studies and experimental models, the present review points out that altered AGE deposition is a common feature in all PCOS phenotypes. Searching for possible mechanisms involved in the adaptive response against glycation injury in oocytes and ovaries, the role of SIRT1, the main member of the mammalian sirtuin family, has also recently emerged. Therefore, further studies based on anti-AGE interventions could be helpful in creating innovative strategies for counteracting PCOS and its effects on fertility.",

Remodelling the ECM is believed to be a key event in follicular development, especially during selection, and plays an important role in cell migration, survival, and steroidogenesis. miR-199-3p is differentially expressed in the goose granulosa layer during follicular selection and is reported to play a primary role in inhibiting cell migration and invasion. Nevertheless, the effect of miR-199-3p on ovarian follicles and its role in follicular cellular migration is not understood. 2. In this study, qRT-PCR assays revealed that miR-199-3p was differentially expressed in the granulosa layer from goose ovarian follicles before and after follicular selection. Additionally, miR-199-3p overexpression in cultured granulosa cells (GCs) from goose pre-hierarchical follicles significantly suppressed cell viability and migration. It elevated the concentration of progesterone and the expression of key progesterone production genes. Furthermore, miR-199-3p overexpression in the GCs of goose pre-hierarchical follicles inhibited the expression of ECM-related genes (ITGB8, MMP9 and MMP15) yet promoted the expression of another two ECM-related genes (COL4A1 and LAMA1). Finally, dual-fluorescence reporter experiments on 293T cells established the direct targeting of ECM gene ITGB8 by miR-199-3p. 3. In conclusion, miR-199-3p may participate in granulosa cell migration, viability, and steroidogenesis in goose ovarian follicles before selection by modulating ITGB8 and other ECM-related genes.",

        "abstract": "This review will summarize the ovarian morphological and functional context that contributes to follicle recruitment, growth and ovulation, as well as to the acquisition of oocyte developmental competence, and describe the changes occurring during folliculogenesis. BACKGROUND\nFolliculogenesis occurs in the highly dynamic environment of the ovary. Follicle cyclic recruitment, neo-angiogenesis, spatial displacement, follicle atresia and ovulation stand out as major events resulting from the interplay between mechanical forces and molecular signals. Morphological and functional changes to the growing follicle and to the surrounding tissue are required to produce oocytes capable of supporting preimplantation development to the blastocyst stage.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE\nThis review will summarize the ovarian morphological and functional context that contributes to follicle recruitment, growth and ovulation, as well as to the acquisition of oocyte developmental competence. We will describe the changes occurring during folliculogenesis to the ovarian extracellular matrix (ECM) and to the vasculature, their influence on the mechanical properties of the ovarian tissue, and, in turn, their influence on the regulation of signal transduction. Also, we will outline how their dysregulation might be associated with pathologies such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Finally, for each of these three pathologies, we will highlight therapeutic strategies attempting to correct the altered biomechanical context in order to restore fertility.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nFor each area discussed, a systematic bibliographical search was performed, without temporal limits, using PubMed Central, Web of Science and Scopus search engines employing the keywords extracellular matrix, mechanobiology, biomechanics, vasculature, angiogenesis or signalling pathway in combination with: ovary, oogenesis, oocyte, folliculogenesis, ovarian follicle, theca, granulosa, cumulus, follicular fluid, corpus luteum, meiosis, oocyte developmental competence, preimplantation, polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian insufficiency or endometriosis.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nThrough search engines queries, we yielded a total of 37\u200a368 papers that were further selected based on our focus on mammals and, specifically, on rodents, bovine, equine, ovine, primates and human, and also were trimmed around each specific topic of the review. After the elimination of duplicates, this selection process resulted in 628 papers, of which 287 were cited in the manuscript. Among these, 89.2% were published in the past 22\u2009years, while the remaining 8.0%, 2.4% or 0.3% were published during the 1990s, 1980s or before, respectively. During folliculogenesis, changes occur to the ovarian ECM composition and organization that, together with vasculature modelling around the growing follicle, are aimed to sustain its recruitment and growth, and the maturation of the enclosed oocyte. These events define the scenario in which mechanical forces are key to the regulation of cascades of molecular signals. Alterations to this context determine impaired folliculogenesis and decreased oocyte developmental potential, as observed in pathological conditions which are causes of infertility, such as PCOS, endometriosis or POI.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS\nThe knowledge of these mechanisms and the rules that govern them lay a sound basis to explain how follicles recruitment and growth are modulated, and stimulate insights to develop, in clinical practice, strategies to improve follicular recruitment and oocyte competence, particularly for pathologies like PCOS, endometriosis and POI.",

        "abstract": "Recently emerging evidence that dual inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways plays an important role in regulating pluripotency in both rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cells is discussed. Stem cells are unspecialized cells and excellent model in developmental biology and a promising approach to the treatment of disease and injury. In the last 30 years, pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells were established from murine and primate sources, and display indefinite replicative potential and the ability to differentiate to all three embryonic germ layers. Despite large efforts in many aspects of rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cell culture, a number of diverse challenges remain. Natural and synthetic small molecules (SMs) strategy has the potential to overcome these hurdles. Small molecules are typically fast and reversible that target specific signaling pathways, epigenetic processes and other cellular processes. Inhibition of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2/Smad) and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4)/ERK signaling pathways by SB431542 and PD0325901 small molecules, respectively, known as R2i, enhances the efficiency of mouse, rat, and chicken pluripotent stem cells passaging from different genetic backgrounds. Therefore, the application of SM inhibitors of TGF-\u03b2 and ERK1/2 with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) allow the cultivation of pluripotent stem cells in a chemically defined condition. In this review, we discuss recently emerging evidence that dual inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways plays an important role in regulating pluripotency in both rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cells.",

In this study, we applied inhibitors of TGF-\u03b2 (SB431542) and BMP4 (Noggin) from cleavage to blastocyst stage in cattle, goat and sheep embryos. SB significantly decreases blastocyst rate and total cell number (TCN) in sheep blastocysts, whereas only TCN was significantly decreased in cattle blastocysts. In contrast to SB, Noggin significantly improved cattle blastocyst development but decreased TCN. However, Noggin treatment led to a significant increase in TCN in sheep blastocysts. Regarding pluripotency triad (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2) and cell lineage commitment (REX1, CDX2, GATA4), SB led to a significant reduction in SOX2 expression in goat and cattle, while Noggin increased at least one or two of pluripotent markers in these species. Taken together, this data suggests that inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by Noggin may be more favorable for derivation of stem cells in farm animals.",

        "abstract": "Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying ESC derivation in the R2i condition revealed that generation of ESCs in the ground-state of pluripotency could be achieved by inhibiting the MEK and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways in the first 5 days of ESC derivations. Objective Dual inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (also known as MEK) and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) type I receptors by PD0325901 and SB431542, known as R2i has been introduced as a highly efficient approach to the generation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying ESC derivation in the R2i condition. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, zona-free whole E3.5 blastocysts were seeded on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells in both R2i and serum conventional media. The isolated inner cell mass (ICM), ESCs and the ICM-outgrowths were collected on days 3, 5 and 7 post-blastocyst culture for quantitative real time- polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis as well as to assess the DNA methylation status at the time points during the transition from ICM to ESC. Results qRT-PCR revealed a significantly higher expression of the pluripotency-related genes (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Rex1, Dppa3, Tcf3, Utf1, Nodal, Dax1, Sall4 and \u03b2-Catenin) and lower expression of early differentiation genes (Gata6, Lefty2 and Cdx2) in R2i condition compared to the serum condition. Moreover, the upstream region of Oct4 and Nanog showed a progressive increase in methylation levels in the upstream regions of the genes following in R2i or serum conditions, followed by a decrease of DNA methylation in ESCs obtained under R2i. However, the methylation level of ICM outgrowths in the serum condition was much higher than R2i, at levels that could have a repressive effect and therefore explain the absence of expression of these two genes in the serum condition. Conclusion Our investigation revealed that generation of ESCs in the ground-state of pluripotency could be achieved by inhibiting the MEK and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways in the first 5 days of ESC derivation.",

Optimization of an in vitro culture that supports blastocyst (BL) development from single blastomeres (SBs) is essential to generate additional embryos for farm animals and humans and unravel the mechanisms that underlie totipotency. In this study, we have examined BL development from SBs that were derived from 2\u2010cell and 4\u2010cell mouse embryos in different media. Moreover, BLs were assessed for inner cell mass (ICM) by staining with Oct4. We found that BL development was improved in a lower volume of medium (1\u2009\u00b5L) compared with a higher volume (5\u2009\u00b5L). Furthermore, the supplementation of medium with the inhibitors of ERK1/2 and TGF\u03b2 (R2i) signaling pathways in 1\u2009\u00b5L droplets of T6 medium improved BL development. The co\u2010culture of SBs with intact embryos in the presence of R2i showed more BL development and ICM to trophectoderm cell number ratio in comparison with SB culture and SB group culture. We also observed reduced total cell number, ICM, and trophectoderm cell numbers in all of the SB culture conditions versus intact embryo development. These findings might facilitate the successful generation of additional embryos for biomedical applications and elucidate the mechanisms that underlie totipotency.",

Signaling in pluripotent stem cells is a complex and dynamic process involving multiple mediators, finely tuned to balancing pluripotency and differentiation states. Characterizing and modifying the necessary signaling pathways to attain desired cell types is required for stem-cell applications in various fields of regenerative medicine.

Pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines derived from embryonated avian eggs are a convenient platform for production of various recombinant proteins and vaccines. In chicks, both embryonic stem cells (ESC) and embryonic germ cells (EGC) are considered to be pluripotent cells obtained from early blastodermal cells (stage X) and gonadal tissues (stage HH28), respectively. However, the establishment and long\u2010term maintenance of avian PSC lines faces several challenges and differs in efficiency between chick strains. This study aims to determine the effects of PSC culture media, including serum\u2010based and serum\u2010free media as well as various feeder layers, growth factors, and small molecules on derivation and maintenance of avian embryonic derived\u2010PSCs.

Materials and Methods In this experimental study, we examined the transcripts that encoded the ligand, receptor, intracellular signal transducer and modifier, and the down- stream effector, for each signaling pathway. In vitro mature MII oocytes and embryos at three distinctive stages [8-16 cell stage, day-7 (D7) blastocysts and day-14 (D14) blas- tocysts] were separately prepared in triplicate for comparative real-time reverse tran- scriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the selected gene sets. Results Most components of the three signaling pathways were present at more or less stable levels throughout the assessed oocyte and embryo developmental stages. The transcripts for TGF-\u03b2, FGF and WNT signaling pathways were all induced in unfertilized MII-oocytes. However, developing embryos showed gradual patterns of decrease in the activities of TGF-\u03b2, FGF and WNT components with renewal thereafter. Conclusion The results suggested that TGF-\u03b2, FGF and WNT are maternally active signaling pathways required during earlier, rather than later, stages of preand peri- implantation goat embryo development.",

        "abstract": "It is proposed that lack of myostatin epigenetically reprograms the MDSCs to become pluripotent stem cells, and the successful establishment of ES-like cells from adult stem cells of the non-germline origin under culture-induced conditions without introducing reprogramming genes is reported. Muscle derived stem cells (MDSCs) are multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into several lineages including skeletal muscle precursor cells. Here, we show that MDSCs from myostatin null mice (Mstn\u2212/\u2212) can be readily induced into pluripotent stem cells without using reprogramming factors. Microarray studies revealed a strong upregulation of markers like Leukemia Inhibitory factor (LIF) and Leukemia Inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) in Mstn\u2212/\u2212 MDSCs as compared to wild type MDSCs (WT-MDSCs). Furthermore when cultured in mouse embryonic stem cell media with LIF for 95 days, Mstn\u2212/\u2212 MDSCs formed embryonic stem cell (ES) like colonies. We termed such ES like cells as the culture-induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSC). CiPSCs from Mstn\u2212/\u2212 MDSCs were phenotypically similar to ESCs, expressed high levels of Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and SSEA-1, maintained a normal karyotype. Furthermore, CiPSCs formed embryoid bodies and teratomas when injected into immunocompromised mice. In addition, CiPSCs differentiated into somatic cells of all three lineages. We further show that culturing in ES cell media, resulted in hypermethylation and downregulation of BMP2 in Mstn\u2212/\u2212 MDSCs. Western blot further confirmed a down regulation of BMP2 signaling in Mstn\u2212/\u2212 MDSCs in supportive of pluripotent reprogramming. Given that down regulation of BMP2 has been shown to induce pluripotency in cells, we propose that lack of myostatin epigenetically reprograms the MDSCs to become pluripotent stem cells. Thus, here we report the successful establishment of ES-like cells from adult stem cells of the non-germline origin under culture-induced conditions without introducing reprogramming genes.",

PurposeTo assess the role of the genetic background, the culture medium supplements, and the presence of modulators of signaling pathways on mouse embryonic stem cell derivation from single blastomeres from 8-cell embryos.MethodsMice from permissive and non-permissive genetic backgrounds, different culture media supplements, knockout serum replacement (KSR) and N2B27, and the presence or absence of 2i treatment were used to derive mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) from single blastomeres isolated from 8-cell embryos and from control embryos at the blastocyst stage. After the sixth passage, the putative mESC were analyzed by immunofluorescence to assess their pluripotency and, after in vitro differentiation induction, their ability to differentiate into derivatives of the three primary germ layers. Selected mESC lines derived from single blastomeres in the most efficient culture conditions were further characterized to validate their stemness.ResultsIn control embryos, high mESC derivation efficiencies (70\u201396.9%) were obtained from permissive backgrounds or when embryos were cultured in medium complemented with 2i regardless of their genetic background. By contrast, only blastomeres isolated from embryos from permissive background cultured in KSR-containing medium complemented with 2i were moderately successful in the derivation of mESC lines (22.9\u201324.5%). Moreover, we report for the first time that B6CBAF2 embryos behave as permissive in terms of mESC derivation.ConclusionsSingle blastomeres have higher requirements than whole blastocysts for pluripotency maintenance and mESC derivation. The need for 2i suggests that modulation of signaling pathways to recreate a commitment towards inner cell mass could be essential to efficiently derive mESC from single blastomeres.",

Objective Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into all other cell types, are of benefit in regenerative medicine applications. Tightly controlled gene expression networks and epigenetic factors regulate these properties. In this study, we aim to evaluate the metabolic signature of pluripotency under 2i and R2i culture conditions versus serum condition. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, we investigated bioinformatics analysis of the shotgun proteomics data for cells grown under 2i, R2i, and serum culture conditions. The findings were validated by cell cycle analysis and gene expressions of the cells with flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. Results Expressions of 163 proteins increased in 2i-grown cells and 181 proteins increased in R2i-grown cells versus serum, which were mostly involved in glycolysis signaling pathway, oxidation-reduction, metabolic processes, amino acid and lipid metabolism. Flow cytometry analysis showed significant accumulation of cells in S phase for 2i (70%) and R2i (61%) grown cells. Conclusion This study showed that under 2i and R2i conditions, glycolysis was highlighted for energy production and used to maintain high levels of glycolytic intermediates to support cell proliferation. Cells grown under 2i and R2i conditions showed rapid cell cycling in comparison with the cells grown under serum conditions.",

        "abstract": "Recently emerging evidence that dual inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways plays an important role in regulating pluripotency in both rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cells is discussed. Stem cells are unspecialized cells and excellent model in developmental biology and a promising approach to the treatment of disease and injury. In the last 30 years, pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells were established from murine and primate sources, and display indefinite replicative potential and the ability to differentiate to all three embryonic germ layers. Despite large efforts in many aspects of rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cell culture, a number of diverse challenges remain. Natural and synthetic small molecules (SMs) strategy has the potential to overcome these hurdles. Small molecules are typically fast and reversible that target specific signaling pathways, epigenetic processes and other cellular processes. Inhibition of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2/Smad) and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4)/ERK signaling pathways by SB431542 and PD0325901 small molecules, respectively, known as R2i, enhances the efficiency of mouse, rat, and chicken pluripotent stem cells passaging from different genetic backgrounds. Therefore, the application of SM inhibitors of TGF-\u03b2 and ERK1/2 with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) allow the cultivation of pluripotent stem cells in a chemically defined condition. In this review, we discuss recently emerging evidence that dual inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways plays an important role in regulating pluripotency in both rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cells.",

ABSTRACT Introduction: Pluripotency emerges transiently during embryogenesis in two main forms with different developmental potential, termed na\u00efve and primed states. Importantly, these pluripotent states can be recapitulated in vitro under specific culture conditions, representing a unique model to study the regulatory principles of development and cellular plasticity. Areas covered: A complex network of signaling pathways that senses intrinsic and extrinsic cues controls the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Much of our knowledge on this tight regulation originates from epigenetic and transcriptomic approaches. However, the presence of post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms demands a direct assessment of the proteome in its multiple facets. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is now a mature technique and has started to deliver new insights in the stem cell field. Expert opinion: Here, we review our current understanding on the mechanisms that dictate the spectrum of pluripotency levels. We put special emphasis on the emerging proteomic studies that focused on the molecular properties behind the na\u00efve and primed states. In addition, we hypothesize on the impact that future developments in proteomic technologies can have to improve our view of pluripotency.",

        "abstract": "Surprisingly, the magnitude and dynamics of ERK signalling were not strongly coupled to the loss of pluripotency marker expression, implying the normal dynamic range of ERk signalling is not rate-limiting in single cells during differentiation. Stimulation of the ERK/MAPK pathway is required for the exit from pluripotency and onset of differentiation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Many markers of pluripotency show heterogeneous expression under standard ES cell culture conditions, reflecting varying tendencies for either pluripotency and being primed for differentiation. Inhibition of the ERK/MAPK pathway causes much of this heterogeneity to be lost, driving cells into a more pluripotent state. However, immunofluorescence revealed only a weak relationship with levels of pERK and pluripotency markers at the single cell level, implying the magnitude of ERK signalling may only have a weak input into cell state. The aim of this work was to gain insight into the relationship between ERK activity dynamics and ES cell differentiation. To enable this I implemented a FRET-based biosensor to monitor ERK signalling dynamics in single living cells. I found that ERK activity was highly heterogeneous, with considerable variability in ERK signalling between single cells within ES cell colonies. Surprisingly, the magnitude and dynamics of ERK signalling were not strongly coupled to the loss of pluripotency marker expression, implying the normal dynamic range of ERK signalling is not rate-limiting in single cells during differentiation. Using custom-built image analysis software, I demonstrated that ERK signalling dynamics were sensitive to the degree of cell crowding, and were similar in neighbouring cells. By imaging cell lineages, I showed that sister cells from a mitotic division were highly correlated in their ERK activity, an effect that was apparent whether cells remained adjacent or moved apart after division, suggesting cell autonomous inheritance of cell signalling state. Overall, these data imply a combination of cell lineage and niche contributes to the absolute level of ERK signalling in mouse ES cells.",

        "abstract": "This review examines how differences in culture media impact on the characteristics of pluripotency via modulation of GRN during the course of ICM outgrowth into ESCs and discusses generation of ESCs from human embryos and domesticated animals. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are immortal stem cells that own multi-lineage differentiation potential. ESCs are commonly derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of pre-implantation embryos. Due to their tremendous developmental capacity and unlimited self-renewal, ESCs have diverse biomedical applications. Different culture media have been developed to procure and maintain ESCs in a state of na\u00efve pluripotency, and to preserve a stable genome and epigenome during serial passaging. Chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications along with microRNA activity and different signaling pathways dynamically contribute to the regulation of the ESC gene regulatory network (GRN). Such modifications undergo remarkable changes in different ESC media and determine the quality and developmental potential of ESCs. In this review, we discuss the current approaches for derivation and maintenance of ESCs, and examine how differences in culture media impact on the characteristics of pluripotency via modulation of GRN during the course of ICM outgrowth into ESCs. We also summarize the current hypotheses concerning the origin of ESCs and provide a perspective about the relationship of these cells to their in vivo counterparts (early embryonic cells around the time of implantation). Finally, we discuss generation of ESCs from human embryos and domesticated animals, and offer suggestions to further advance this fascinating field.",

        "abstract": "The results indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an inability to support the pluripotency maintenance, and down-regulated glutathione metabolism and up-regulated focal adhesion reinforced and stabilized the process of differentiation by separately enhancing OCT4 degradation and promoting cell spread. Mitochondria play a central role in the maintenance of the naive state of embryonic stem cells. Many details of the mechanism remain to be fully elucidated. Solute carrier family 25 member 36 (Slc25a36) might regulate mitochondrial function through transporting pyrimidine nucleotides for mtDNA/RNA synthesis. Its physical role in this process remains unknown; however, Slc25a36 was recently found to be highly expressed in naive mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Here, the function of Slc25a36 was characterized as a maintenance factor of mESCs pluripotency. Slc25a36 deficiency (via knockdown) has been demonstrated to result in mitochondrial dysfunction, which induces the differentiation of mESCs. The expression of key pluripotency markers (Pou5f1, Sox2, Nanog, and Utf1) decreased, while that of key TE genes (Cdx2, Gata3, and Hand1) increased. Cdx2-positive cells emerged in Slc25a36-deficient colonies under trophoblast stem cell culture conditions. As a result of Slc25a36 deficiency, mtDNA of knockdown cells declined, leading to impaired mitochondria with swollen morphology, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and low numbers. The key transcription regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis also decreased. These results indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an inability to support the pluripotency maintenance. Moreover, down-regulated glutathione metabolism and up-regulated focal adhesion reinforced and stabilized the process of differentiation by separately enhancing OCT4 degradation and promoting cell spread. This study improves the understanding of the function of Slc25a36, as well as the relationship of mitochondrial function with naive pluripotency maintenance and stem cell fate decision.",

        "abstract": "The potential of cSAPs on the expansion and early-stage blood cell lineage differentiation of hPSCs is revealed and enhances the pluripotency and the hematopoietic potential of hESCs that subsequently generates more blood-like cells. The generation of blood cells in a significant amount for clinical uses is still challenging. Human pluripotent stem cells-derived hemopoietic cells (hPSC-HCs) are a promising cell source to generate blood cells. Previously, it has been shown that the attached substrates are crucial in the maintenance or differentiation of hPSCs. In this study, a new family of artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) called colloidal self-assembled patterns (cSAPs: #1\u2013#5) was used for the expansion of mouse and human PSCs. The optimized cSAP (i.e., #4 and #5) was selected for subsequent hemopoietic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Results showed that the hematopoietic potential of hESCs was enhanced approx 3\u20134 folds on cSAP #5 compared to the flat control. The cell population of hematopoietic progenitors (i.e., CD34+CD43+ cells) and erythroid progenitors (i.e., CD71+GPA+ cells) were enhanced 4 folds at day 8 and 3 folds at day 14. RNA sequencing analysis of cSAP-derived hESCs showed that there were 300 genes up-regulated and 627 genes down-regulated compared to the flat control. The enriched signaling pathways, including up-regulation (i.e., Toll-like receptor, HIF-1a, and Notch) or down-regulation (i.e., FAs, MAPK, JAK/STAT, and TGF-\u03b2) were classic in the maintenance of hESC phenotype Real time PCR confirmed that the expression of focal adhesion (PTK2, VCL, and CXCL14) and MAPK signaling (CAV1) related genes was down-regulated 2-3 folds compared to the flat control. Altogether, cSAP enhances the pluripotency and the hematopoietic potential of hESCs that subsequently generates more blood-like cells. This study reveals the potential of cSAPs on the expansion and early-stage blood cell lineage differentiation of hPSCs.",

Bovine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bBMSC) are potential stem cell source which can be used for multipurpose. However, their application is limited because the in vitro maintenance of these cells is usually accompanied by aging and multipotency losing. Considering transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathway inhibitor Repsox is beneficial for cell reprogramming, here we investigated its impacts on the maintenance and differentiation of bBMSC. The bBMSC were enriched and characterized by morphology, immunofluorescent staining, flow cytometry, and multilineage differentiation. The impacts of Repsox on their proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, multipotency, and differentiation were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), real-time polymerase chain reaction, induced differentiation and specific staining. The results showed that highly purified cluster of diffrentiation 73+ (CD73 + )/CD90 + /CD105 + /CD34 - /CD45 - bBMSC with adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation capacities were enriched. Repsox treatments (5\u2009\u03bcM, 48\u2009hr) enhanced the messenger RNA mRNA levels of the proliferation gene (telomerase reverse transcriptase [ TERT]; basic fibroblast growth factor [ bFGF]), apoptosis-related gene ( bax and Bcl2), antiapoptosis ratio ( Bcl2/bax), and pluripotency marker gene ( Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog), instead of changing the cell cycle, in bBMSC. Repsox treatments also enhanced the osteogenic differentiation but attenuated the chondrogenic differentiation of bBMSC, concomitant with decreased Smad2 and increased Smad3/4 expressions in TGF-\u03b2 pathway. Collectively, inhibiting TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling by Repsox regulates the in vitro maintenance and differentiation of bBMSC.",

Using a heterokaryon system, Mai et al. demonstrate that NKX3-1 is downstream of IL-6\u2013STAT3, regulates endogenous OCT4 expression during human iPSC reprogramming, and can also substitute for exogenous OCT4 in the reprogramming cocktail.AbstractReprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is now routinely accomplished by overexpression of the four Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC (or OSKM))1. These iPSCs can be derived from patients\u2019 somatic cells and differentiated toward diverse fates, serving as a resource for basic and translational research. However, mechanistic insights into regulators and pathways that initiate the pluripotency network remain to be resolved. In particular, naturally occurring molecules that activate endogenous OCT4 and replace exogenous OCT4 in human iPSC reprogramming have yet to be found. Using a heterokaryon reprogramming system we identified NKX3-1 as an early and transiently expressed homeobox transcription factor. Following knockdown of NKX3-1, iPSC reprogramming is abrogated. NKX3-1 functions downstream of the IL-6\u2013STAT3 regulatory network to activate endogenous OCT4. Importantly, NKX3-1 substitutes for exogenous OCT4 to reprogram both mouse and human fibroblasts at comparable efficiencies and generate fully pluripotent stem cells. Our findings establish an essential role for NKX3-1, a prostate-specific tumour suppressor, in iPSC reprogramming.",

The rapid induction of pluripotency-inducing factor Oct4 in the injured retina necessitates the de novo induction of stem cells and their subsequent cell cycle exit. Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4, also known as Pou5F3) is an essential pluripotency-inducing factor, governing a plethora of biological functions during cellular reprogramming. Retina regeneration in zebrafish involves reprogramming of M\u00fcller glia (MG) into a proliferating population of progenitors (MGPCs) with stem cell\u2013like characteristics, along with up-regulation of pluripotency-inducing factors. However, the significance of Oct4 during retina regeneration remains elusive. In this study, we show an early panretinal induction of Oct4, which is essential for MG reprogramming through the regulation of several regeneration-associated factors such as Ascl1a, Lin28a, Sox2, Zeb, E-cadherin, and various miRNAs, namely, let-7a, miR-200a/miR-200b, and miR-143/miR-145. We also show the crucial roles played by Oct4 during cell cycle exit of MGPCs in collaboration with members of nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex such as Hdac1. Notably, Oct4 regulates Tgf-\u03b2 signaling negatively during MG reprogramming, and positively to cause cycle exit of MGPCs. Our study reveals unique mechanistic involvement of Oct4, during MG reprogramming and cell cycle exit in zebrafish, which may also account for the inefficient retina regeneration in mammals.",

Simple Summary Many aspects of the regulatory mechanisms of somatic cell reprogramming\u2014the conversion of any cell type into pluripotent stem cells\u2014still remain elusive. The tumor suppressor CYLD regulates several signaling pathways involved in this process. However, its potential role in reprogramming has not been investigated. In this work, we present evidence that CYLD exerts important regulatory control at the early stages of reprogramming. Loss of CYLD catalytic activity leads to the reduced reprogramming efficiency of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Whole proteome analysis during early reprogramming stages revealed that CYLD DUB deficiency impedes a vital early reprogramming step known as the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Our findings expand our knowledge of early reprogramming mechanics and reveal a novel role for CYLD as an extracellular matrix regulator. Abstract CYLD is a tumor suppressor gene coding for a deubiquitinating enzyme that has a critical regulatory function in a variety of signaling pathways and biological processes involved in cancer development and progression, many of which are also key modulators of somatic cell reprogramming. Nevertheless, the potential role of CYLD in this process has not been studied. With the dual aim of investigating the involvement of CYLD in reprogramming and developing a better understanding of the intricate regulatory system governing this process, we reprogrammed control (CYLDWT/WT) and CYLD DUB-deficient (CYLD\u03949/\u03949) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) through ectopic overexpression of the Yamanaka factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, c-myc). CYLD DUB deficiency led to significantly reduced reprogramming efficiency and slower early reprogramming kinetics. The introduction of WT CYLD to CYLD\u03949/\u03949 MEFs rescued the phenotype. Nevertheless, CYLD DUB-deficient cells were capable of establishing induced pluripotent colonies with full spontaneous differentiation potential of the three germ layers. Whole proteome analysis (Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD044220) revealed that the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) during the early reprogramming stages was disrupted in CYLD\u03949/\u03949 MEFs. Interestingly, differentially enriched pathways revealed that the primary processes affected by CYLD DUB deficiency were associated with the organization of the extracellular matrix and several metabolic pathways. Our findings not only establish for the first time CYLD\u2019s significance as a regulatory component of early reprogramming but also highlight its role as an extracellular matrix regulator, which has profound implications in cancer research.",

ABSTRACT Although derivation of na\u00efve bovine embryonic stem cells is unachieved, the possibility for generation of bovine induced pluripotent stem cells (biPSCs) has been generally reported. However, attempts to sustain biPSCs by promoting self-renewal have not been successful. Methods established for maintaining murine and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) do not support self-renewal of iPSCs for any bovid species. In this study, we examined methods to enhance complete reprogramming and concurrently investigated signaling relevant to pluripotency of the bovine blastocyst inner cell mass (ICM). First, we identified that forced expression of SV40 large T antigen together with the reprogramming genes (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC) substantially enhanced the reprogramming efficacy of bovine fibroblasts to biPSCs. Second, we uncovered that TGF\u03b2 signaling is actively perturbed in the ICM. Inhibition of ALK4/5/7 to block TGF\u03b2/activin/nodal signaling together with GSK3\u03b2 and MEK1/2 supported robust in vitro self-renewal of na\u00efve biPSCs with unvarying colony morphology, steady expansion, expected pluripotency gene expression and committed differentiation plasticity. Core similarities between biPSCs and stem cells of the 16-cell-stage bovine embryo indicated a stable ground state of pluripotency; this allowed us to reliably gain predictive understanding of signaling in bovine pluripotency using systems biology approaches. Beyond defining a high-fidelity platform for advancing biPSC-based biotechnologies that have not been previously practicable, these findings also represent a significant step towards understanding corollaries and divergent aspects of bovine pluripotency. This article has an associated First Person interview with the joint first authors of the paper.",

We have previously reported that Ahnak-mediated TGF\u03b2 signaling leads to down-regulation of c-Myc expression. Here, we show that inhibition of Ahnak can promote generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) via up-regulation of endogenous c-Myc. Consistent with the c-Myc inhibitory role of Ahnak, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Ahnak-deficient mouse (Ahnak\u2212/\u2212 MEF) show an increased level of c-Myc expression compared with wild type MEF. Generation of iPSC with just three of the four Yamanaka factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (hereafter 3F), was significantly enhanced in Ahnak\u2212/\u2212 MEF. Similar results were obtained when Ahnak-specific shRNA was applied to wild type MEF. Of note, expressionof Ahnak was significantly induced during the formation of embryoid bodies from embryonic stem cells, suggesting that Ahnak-mediated c-Myc inhibition is involved in embryoid body formation and the initial differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. The iPSC from 3F-infected Ahnak\u2212/\u2212 MEF cells (Ahnak\u2212/\u2212-iPSC-3F) showed expression of all stem cell markers examined and the capability to form three primary germ layers. Moreover, injection of Ahnak\u2212/\u2212-iPSC-3F into athymic nude mice led to development of teratoma containing tissues from all three primary germ layers, indicating that iPSC from Ahnak\u2212/\u2212 MEF are bona fide pluripotent stem cells. Taken together, these data provide evidence for a new role for Ahnak in cell fate determination during development and suggest that manipulation of Ahnak and the associated signaling pathway may provide a means to regulate iPSC generation.",

Abstract Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) share many characteristics with embryonic stem cells, but lack ethical controversy. They provide vast opportunities for disease modeling, pathogenesis understanding, therapeutic drug development, toxicology, organ synthesis, and treatment of degenerative disease. However, this procedure also has many potential challenges, including a slow generation time, low efficiency, partially reprogrammed colonies, as well as somatic coding mutations in the genome. Pioneered by Shinya Yamanaka's team in 2006, iPSCs were first generated by introducing four transcription factors: Oct 4, Sox 2, Klf 4, and c-Myc (OSKM). Of those factors, Klf 4 and c-Myc are oncogenes, which are potentially a tumor risk. Therefore, to avoid problems such as tumorigenesis and low throughput, one of the key strategies has been to use other methods, including members of the same subgroup of transcription factors, activators or inhibitors of signaling pathways, microRNAs, epigenetic modifiers, o...",

        "abstract": "The role of FGF signaling is summarized in the maintenance of pluripotency state of stem cells through regulation of key transcriptional factors. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) isolated in vitro from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced PSC (iPSC) and also post-implantation epiblast-derived stem cells (EpiSCs) are known for their two unique characteristics: the ability to give rise to all somatic lineages and the self-renewal capacity. Numerous intrinsic signaling pathways contribute to the maintenance of the pluripotency state of stem cells by tightly controlling key transcriptional regulators of stemness including sex determining region Y box 2 (Sox-2), octamer-binding transcription factor (Oct)3/4, krueppel-like factor 4 (Klf-4), Nanog, and c-Myc. Signaling by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is of critical importance in regulating stem cells pluripotency. The FGF family is comprised of 22 ligands that interact with four FGF receptors (FGFRs). FGF/FGFR signaling governs fundamental cellular processes such as cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, embryonic development, organogenesis, tissue repair/regeneration, and metabolism. FGF signaling is mediated by the activation of RAS \u2013 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT, Phospholipase C Gamma (PLC\u03b3), and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), which intersects and synergizes with other signaling pathways such as Wnt, retinoic acid (RA) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 signaling. In the current review, we summarize the role of FGF signaling in the maintenance of pluripotency state of stem cells through regulation of key transcriptional factors.",

Islet\u2010cells transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach based on in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to insulin\u2010producing cells (IPCs). According to evolutionary stages in \u03b2\u2010cell development, there are several distinct checkpoints; each one has a unique characteristic, including definitive endoderm (DE), primitive gut (PG), posterior foregut (PF), pancreatic epithelium (PE), endocrine precursor (EP), and immature \u03b2\u2010cells up to functional \u03b2\u2010cells. A better understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRN) and associated transcription factors in each specific developmental stage, guarantees the achievement of the next successful checkpoints and ensures an efficient \u03b2\u2010cell differentiation procedure.

The emergence of germ layers in embryos during gastrulation is a key developmental milestone. How morphogenetic signals engage the regulatory networks responsible for early embryonic tissue patterning is incompletely understood. To understand this, we developed a gene regulatory network (GRN) model of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lineage commitment and embedded it into \u2018cellular\u2019 agents that respond to a dynamic signalling microenvironment. We found that cellular pattern order, composition, and dynamics were predictably manipulable based on the GRN wiring. We showed that feedback between OCT4, and BMP and WNT pathways created a dynamic OCT4 front that mediates the spatiotemporal evolution of developmental patterns. Translocation of this radial front can be predictively disrupted in vitro to control germ-layer pattern composition. This work links the emergence of multicellular patterns to regulatory network activity in individual hPSCs. We anticipate our approach will help to understand how GRN structure regulates organogenesis in different contexts.",

Activin-like factors control many developmental processes, including pluripotency maintenance and differentiation. Although Activin-like factors' action in mesendoderm induction has been demonstrated in zebrafish, their involvement in preserving the stemness remains unknown. To investigate the role of maternal Activin-like factors, their effects were promoted or blocked using synthetic human Activin A or SB-431542 treatments respectively until the maternal to zygotic transition. To study the role of zygotic Activin-like factors, SB-431542 treatment was also applied after the maternal to zygotic transition. The effect of the pharmacological modulations of the Activin/Smad pathway was then studied on the mRNA expressions of the ndr1, ndr2, tbxta (no tail/ntl) as the differentiation index, mych, nanog, and oct4 (pou5f3) as the pluripotency markers of the zebrafish embryonic cells as well as sox17 as a definitive endoderm marker. Expression of the target genes was measured at the 16-cell, 256-cell, 1K-cell, oblong, dome, and shield stages using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Activation of the maternal Activin signaling pathway led to an increase in zygotic expression of the tbxta, particularly marked at the oblong stage. In other words, promotion of the maternal Activin/Smad pathway induced differentiation by advancing the major peaks of ndr1 and nanog, thereby eliciting tbxta expression. Whereas suppression of the maternal or zygotic Activin/Smad pathway sustained the pluripotency by preventing the major peaks of ndr1 and nanog as well as tbxta encoding.",

CXC-chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), a 7-transmembrane receptor family member, displays multifaceted roles, participating in immune cell migration, angiogenesis, and even adipocyte metabolism. However, the activity of such a ubiquitously expressed receptor in epithelial gland organogenesis has not yet been fully explored. To investigate the relationship between CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling and embryonic glandular organogenesis, we used an ex vivo culture system with live imaging and RNA sequencing to elucidate the transcriptome and protein-level signatures of AMD3100, a potent abrogating reagent of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis, imprinted on the developing organs. Immunostaining results showed that CXCR4 was highly expressed in embryonic submandibular gland, lung, and pancreas, especially at the periphery of end buds containing numerous embryonic stem/progenitor cells. Despite no significant increase in apoptosis, AMD3100-treated epithelial organs showed a retarded growth with significantly slower branching and expansion. Further analyses with submandibular glands revealed that such responses resulted from the AMD3100-induced precocious differentiation of embryonic epithelial cells, losing mitotic activity. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that inhibition of CXCR4 significantly down-regulated polycomb repressive complex (PRC) components, known as regulators of DNA methylation. Treatment with PRC inhibitor recapitulated the AMD3100-induced precocious differentiation. Our results indicate that the epigenetic modulation by the PRC-CXCR12/CXCR4 signaling axis is crucial for the spatiotemporal regulation of proliferation and differentiation of embryonic epithelial cells during embryonic glandular organogenesis.",

SIRT1 is the most conserved mammalian NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase. Through deacetylation of transcriptional factors and co-factors, this protein modification enzyme is critically involved in metabolic and epigenetic regulation of stem cells, which is functionally important in maintaining their pluripotency and regulating their differentiation. C-Myc, a key member of Myc proton-oncogene family, is a pivotal factor for transcriptional regulation of genes that control acquisition and maintenance of stemness. Previous cancer research has revealed an intriguing positive feedback loop between SIRT1 and c-Myc that is crucial in tumorigenesis. Recent literature has uncovered important functions of this axis in regulation of maintenance and differentiation of stem cells, including pluripotent stem cells and cancer stem cells. This review highlights recent advances of the SIRT1-c-Myc axis in stem cells.",

To investigate the role of maternal Activin-like factors in the preservation of stemness and mesendoderm induction, their effects were promoted and inhibited using synthetic human Activin A or SB-505124 treatments, respectively, before the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). To study the role of zygotic Activin-like factors, SB-505124 treatment was also used after the MZT. Promoting the signaling intensity of maternal Activin-like factors led to premature differentiation, loss of stemness, and no mesendoderm malformation, while its alleviation delayed the differentiation and caused various malformations. Inhibition of the zygotic Activin-like factors was associated with suppressing the notail transcription, differentiation retardation at the oblong stage, and a broad spectrum of anomalies in a dosedependent manner.

TGF\u03b2-superfamily consists a plethora of extracellular growth factors, modulating developmental procedures and homeostasis in vertebrates and invertebrates. TGF\u03b2-superfamily ligands, synthesized as the large inactive precursors, transform into active ligands following by their interaction with extracellular proteolytic enzymes. Principally, TGF\u03b2s ligation to their responsive receptors can trigger two distinct transduction cascades, including 1- SMAD dependent or canonical pathway and 2- SMAD independent or non-canonical ones. R-SMADs are substrates for the type I receptors, as their GS domains act as a docking site for R-SMADs. In the canocical pathway, upon phosphorylation of SSXS of MH2, two phosphorylated-SMADs (P-SMADs) in accordance with receptor tetra-dimerization, homo or heterodimerize and then form a trimer complex by SMAD4. The trimers translocate to the nucleus, where in association with other transcription factors (activators and repressors) modulate their target genes expression. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive information about these cascades and their downstream effectors with an emphasis on the canonical one.",

The mechanical properties of naturally-derived matrices and biomaterials are thought to play an important role in directing cell adhesion, spreading, motility, proliferation and differentiation. However, recent reports have indicated that cells may respond to local nanoscale physical cues, rather than bulk mechanical properties. We had previously reported that primary keratinocytes and mesenchymal stem cells did not seem to respond to the bulk mechanical properties of poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) substrates. In this study, we examine the mechanical properties of weakly crosslinked PDMS substrates and observe a liquid-like behaviour, with complete stress relaxation. We then report the observation that HaCaT cells, an epidermal cell line, proliferate readily at the surface of uncrosslinked liquid PDMS, as well as on low viscosity (0.77 cSt) fluorinated oil. These results are surprising, considering current views in the field of mechanotransduction on the importance of bulk mechanical properties, but we find that strong mechanical interfaces, presumably resulting from protein assembly, are formed at liquid-liquid interfaces for which cell adhesion and proliferation are observed. Hence our results suggest that cells sense the nanoscale mechanical properties of liquid-liquid interfaces and that such physical cues are sufficient to sustain the proliferation of adherent cells.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that rat EG cells could be generated in the presence of two inhibitors that suppressed the above mentioned pathways and demonstrated the hallmarks of pluripotency in protein expression level. Objective Embryonic germ (EG) cells are the results of reprogramming primordial germ cells (PGC) in vitro. Studying these cells can be of benefit in determining the mechanism by which specialized cells acquire pluripotency. Therefore in the current study we have tried to derive rat EG cells with inhibition of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) signaling pathways. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, rat PGCs were cultured under feeder free condition with two small molecules that inhibited the above mentioned pathways. Under this condition only two-day presence of stem cell factor (SCF) as a survival factor was applied for PGC reprogramming. Pluripotency of the resultant EG cells were further confirmed by immunofluorescent staining, directed differentiation ability to neural and cardiac cells, and their contribution to teratoma formation as well. Moreover, chromosomal stability of two different EG cells were assessed through G-banding technique. Results Formerly, derivation of rat EG cells were observed solely in the presence of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3\u03b2) and MEK pathway inhibitors. Due to some drawbacks of inhibiting GSK3\u03b2 molecules such as increases in chromosomal aberrations, in the present study we have attempted to assess a feeder-free protocol that derives EG cells by the simultaneous suppression of TGF\u03b2 signaling and the MEK pathway. We have shown that rat EG cells could be generated in the presence of two inhibitors that suppressed the above mentioned pathways. Of note, inhibition of TGF\u03b2 instead of GSK3\u03b2 significantly maintained chromosomal integrity. The resultant EG cells demonstrated the hallmarks of pluripotency in protein expression level and also showed in vivo and in vitro differentiation capacities. Conclusion Rat EG cells with higher karyotype stability establish from PGCs by inhibiting TGF\u03b2 and MEK signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "This chapter reviews various methods to achieve PGC reprogramming, as well as the molecular pathways involved, and focuses on soluble factors and genetic strategies to obtain pluripotent cells from PGCs. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the embryonic precursors of the gametes. Thus, they are unipotent cells. However, PGCs share some common features with pluripotent stem cells. Among them, PGCs show alkaline phosphatase activity and express stage-specific embryonic antigens and pluripotency factors Lin28, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Under specific conditions, they undergo spontaneous reprogramming in vivo. Moreover, they can be easily reprogrammed in vitro into pluripotent embryonic germ cells (EGCs) by culturing them in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor or the epigenetic modulator trichostatin A. Previous work in our laboratory has also proven that hypoxia alone can reprogram PGCs into hypoxia-induced embryonic germ-like cells, which have a pluripotent phenotype but which do not show self-renewal capacity. Therefore, PGCs are an interesting model to further comprehensively understand the process of cell reprogramming. This chapter reviews various methods to achieve PGC reprogramming, as well as the molecular pathways involved. We focus on soluble factors and genetic strategies to obtain pluripotent cells from PGCs.

        "abstract": "This chapter reviews various methods to achieve PGC reprogramming, as well as the molecular pathways involved, and focuses on soluble factors and genetic strategies to obtain pluripotent cells from PGCs. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the embryonic precursors of the gametes. Thus, they are unipotent cells. However, PGCs share some common features with pluripotent stem cells. Among them, PGCs show alkaline phosphatase activity and express stage-specific embryonic antigens and pluripotency factors Lin28, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Under specific conditions, they undergo spontaneous reprogramming in vivo. Moreover, they can be easily reprogrammed in vitro into pluripotent embryonic germ cells (EGCs) by culturing them in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor or the epigenetic modulator trichostatin A. Previous work in our laboratory has also proven that hypoxia alone can reprogram PGCs into hypoxia-induced embryonic germ-like cells, which have a pluripotent phenotype but which do not show self-renewal capacity. Therefore, PGCs are an interesting model to further comprehensively understand the process of cell reprogramming. This chapter reviews various methods to achieve PGC reprogramming, as well as the molecular pathways involved. We focus on soluble factors and genetic strategies to obtain pluripotent cells from PGCs. Special emphasis will be given to factors implied in energetic metabolism, epigenetics, and cell signaling transduction, both in vitro and in vivo.",

Objective Dual inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (also known as MEK) and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) type I receptors by PD0325901 and SB431542, known as R2i has been introduced as a highly efficient approach to the generation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying ESC derivation in the R2i condition. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, zona-free whole E3.5 blastocysts were seeded on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells in both R2i and serum conventional media. The isolated inner cell mass (ICM), ESCs and the ICM-outgrowths were collected on days 3, 5 and 7 post-blastocyst culture for quantitative real time- polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis as well as to assess the DNA methylation status at the time points during the transition from ICM to ESC. Results qRT-PCR revealed a significantly higher expression of the pluripotency-related genes (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Rex1, Dppa3, Tcf3, Utf1, Nodal, Dax1, Sall4 and \u03b2-Catenin) and lower expression of early differentiation genes (Gata6, Lefty2 and Cdx2) in R2i condition compared to the serum condition. Moreover, the upstream region of Oct4 and Nanog showed a progressive increase in methylation levels in the upstream regions of the genes following in R2i or serum conditions, followed by a decrease of DNA methylation in ESCs obtained under R2i. However, the methylation level of ICM outgrowths in the serum condition was much higher than R2i, at levels that could have a repressive effect and therefore explain the absence of expression of these two genes in the serum condition. Conclusion Our investigation revealed that generation of ESCs in the ground-state of pluripotency could be achieved by inhibiting the MEK and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways in the first 5 days of ESC derivation.",

Pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines derived from embryonated avian eggs are a convenient platform for production of various recombinant proteins and vaccines. In chicks, both embryonic stem cells (ESC) and embryonic germ cells (EGC) are considered to be pluripotent cells obtained from early blastodermal cells (stage X) and gonadal tissues (stage HH28), respectively. However, the establishment and long\u2010term maintenance of avian PSC lines faces several challenges and differs in efficiency between chick strains. This study aims to determine the effects of PSC culture media, including serum\u2010based and serum\u2010free media as well as various feeder layers, growth factors, and small molecules on derivation and maintenance of avian embryonic derived\u2010PSCs. Our results have shown that among the different culture conditions, N2B27 serum\u2010free medium supplemented with PD0325901 and SB431542, MEK and TGF\u03b2 chemical inhibitors, named as R2i and cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) improved PSC derivation from stages X\u2010 and HH28 embryos. The application of N2B27/R2i\u2009+\u2009LIF medium validates the effect of defined pluripotency supporting medium on efficient derivation of chick PSCs and facilitates the use of these cells in biotechnology and biobanking of valuable species.",

Breast cancer is the most common cause of death related to cancer in women, and several studies proved that flavonoids could induce apoptosis in this cancer through different pathways. Calycopterin is a flavonoid which was shown to induce preferential antiproliferative effects on some cancers; however, no information is available on its effect on breast cancer. Therefore, in this paper, the apoptotic effect of calycopterin and its underlying mechanism in two different breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cell lines were investigated. MTT assay showed that calycopterin reduced the proliferation of both cancer lines with no adverse effect on normal cells. The clonogenic assay showed that calycopterin treatments decreased the colony numbers and sizes, and wound healing assay demonstrated the inhibition of migration in both cancer cells. Cell cycle and annexin/PI analyses indicated that calycopterin augmented sub-G1 population and annexin/PI-positive cells. Gene expression revealed that Bax/Bcl2 increased in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, while no change was observed in that of the MCF7 line. Expression of gene caspase-8 was augmented in both lines, although increased expression of caspase-3 was found just in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results validated the apoptotic effect of calycopterin on both breast cancer lines with more potency on triple-negative ones.",

Germ cell tumors (GCTs) arising in infants, children, and adolescents present a set of special challenges. GCTs make up about 3% of malignancies in children aged 0\u201318 and nearly 15% of cancers in adolescents. Epidemiologic and molecular evidence suggests that GCTs in young children likely represent a distinct biologic group as compared to GCTs of older adolescents and adults. Despite this difference, pediatric GCTs are typically treated with cisplatin-based multiagent regimens similar to those used in adults. There is evidence that children are particularly vulnerable to late effects of conventional therapy, including ototoxicity, pulmonary abnormalities, and secondary malignancies, motivating the search for molecular targets for novel therapies. Evidence is accumulating that the genes and mechanisms controlling normal germ cell development are particularly relevant to the understanding of germ cell tumorigenesis. Perturbations in the epigenetic program of germ cell differentiation, with resulting effects on the regulation of pluripotency, may contribute to the marked histologic variability of GCTs. Perturbations in the KIT receptor signaling pathway have been identified via next-generation sequencing studies and in genome-wide association studies of testicular cancer susceptibility. Here, we review these and other biological insights that may fuel further translational and clinical research in childhood GCTs.",

Introduction: Gallic acid (GA) and curcumin (Cur) are natural phenolic compounds that their anti-tumor effects on many types of cancers have been proved. In the current study, the effect of the combination of these agents on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was investigated. Methods: Inhibition of cell proliferation (MTT assay), light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, cell cycle analysis, nitrite detection, ROS levels, measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential, GSH level, Annexin V assay, RT-PCR and Western blotting methods were applied. Results: The results revealed the combination of GA and Cur strongly decreased MDA-MB-231 cell growth. Moreover, this combination increased ROS level and cytotoxic activity along with the glutathione depletion in MDA-MB-231 cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed the combination of GA and Cur increased sub-G1 cell population. Furthermore, fluorescent staining and Annexin V/PI assay showed that apoptotic cells were significantly increased in the presence of GA and Cur. At last, protein expression evaluation showed that the combination of GA and Cur significantly decreased Bcl-2 level while increased Bax, cleaved-caspase3 and PARP levels in MDA-MB-231 cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that GA in combination with Cur could be a possible candidate for chemoprevention agent of triple negative breast cancer.",

Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are pluripotent cells that have the capability for self\u2010renewal. One of the most important factors that affect the efficiency of their isolation is the condition of the mouse embryos. The main objective of this study is to isolate mESCs from C57BL/6 frozen/thawed eight\u2010cell mouse embryos using serum\u2010free culture. We generated mESCs from blastocysts that developed from frozen/thawed embryos of C57BL/6 mice by the 3i\u2009+\u2009LIF medium. Assessments of the isolated mESC lines (MUKF\u20101, MUKF\u20102, and MUKF\u20103) included simple karyotype analysis; polymerase chain reaction of the testis\u2010determining gene (Sry); determination of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity; expressions of pluripotent transcription factors Oct4, Rex1, Sox2, and Nanog by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; and immunocytochemistry assessment of OCT4 and SSEA\u2010I expressions at the protein level. We evaluated the ability of these mESC lines to differentiate into three germ layers by embryoid body (EB) formation. The cell doubling time (DT) of isolated mESCs was determined. The 2\u2010C57 cell line was served as control. Germline competence of the male mESC line (MUKF\u20103) was tested through chimeric mouse production. Three independent mESC lines (MUKF\u20101, MUKF\u20102, and MUKF\u20103) were established from five cryopreserved embryos. The MUKF\u20101 and MUKF\u20102 lines were female, whereas MUKF\u20103 was a male mESC line. Karyotype analysis showed that MUKF\u20103 had a diploid karyotype, whereas MUKF\u20101 and MUKF\u20102 had abnormal karyotypes. All three lines had ALP activity and expressed Oct4, Rex1, and Nanog. Immunocytochemistry assessment for OCT4 and SSEA\u2010I was positive for all three lines. The DT differed in the three mESC lines. MUKF\u20101 and MUKF\u20103 could form EB and express developmental genes after spontaneous differentiation. These data demonstrated that probably cryopreservation affected the efficiency of derivation, karyotype, DT, expression of pluripotency, developmental genes, and differentiation capacity of the independent mESC lines.",

Cancer cells have the ability to divide indefinitely and spread to different parts of the body during metastasis. Embryonic stem cells can self-renew and, through differentiation to somatic cells, provide the building blocks of the human body. Embryonic stem cells offer tremendous opportunities for regenerative medicine and serve as an excellent model system to study early human development. Many of the molecular mechanism underlying tumorigenesis in cancer and self-renewal in stem cells have been elucidated in the past decade. Here we present a systematic analysis of seven major signaling pathways implicated in both cancer and stem cells. We present on overview of the JAK/STAT, Notch, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, NF-kB, Wnt and TGF-\u03b2 pathways and analyze their activation status in the context of cancer and stem cells. We focus on their role in stem cell self-renewal and development and identify key molecules, whose aberrant expression has been associated with malignant phenotypes. We conclude by presenting a map of the signaling networks involved in cancer and embryonic stem cells.",

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are self-renewing cells that maintain pluripotency to differentiate into all types of cells. Because of their potential to provide a variety of tissues for use in regenerative medicine, there is great interest in the identification of growth factors that govern these unique properties of ES cells. However, the signaling pathways controlling ES cell proliferation remain largely unknown. Since transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) superfamily members have been implicated in the processes of early embryogenesis, we investigated their roles in ES cell self-renewal. Inhibition of activin-Nodal-TGF\u03b2 signaling by Smad7 or SB-431542 dramatically decreased ES cell proliferation without decreasing ES pluripotency. By contrast, inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by Smad6 did not exhibit such effects, suggesting that activin-Nodal-TGF\u03b2 signaling, but not BMP signaling, is indispensable for ES cell propagation. In serum-free culture, supplementation of recombinant activin or Nodal, but not TGF\u03b2 or BMP, significantly enhanced ES cell propagation without affecting pluripotency. We also found that activin-Nodal signaling was constitutively activated in an autocrine fashion in serum-free cultured ES cells, and that inhibition of such endogenous signaling by SB-431542 decreased ES cell propagation in serum-free conditions. These findings suggest that endogenously activated autocrine loops of activin-Nodal signaling promote ES cell self-renewal.",

Members of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 superfamily play essential roles in both the pluripotency and differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Although bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) maintain pluripotency of undifferentiated mouse ES cells, the role of autocrine Nodal signaling is less clear. Pharmacological, molecular, and genetic methods were used to further understand the roles and potential interactions of these pathways. Treatment of undifferentiated ES cells with SB431542, a pharmacological inhibitor of Smad2 signaling, resulted in a rapid reduction of phosphorylated Smad2 and altered the expression of several putative downstream targets. Unexpectedly, inhibition of the Nodal signaling pathway resulted in enhanced BMP signaling, as assessed by Smad1/5 phosphorylation. SB431542-treated cells also demonstrated significant induction of the Id genes, which are known direct targets of BMP signaling and important factors in ES cell pluripotency. Inhibition of BMP signaling decreased the SB431542-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1/5 and induction of Id genes, suggesting that BMP signaling is necessary for some Smad2-mediated activity. Because Smad7, a known inhibitory factor to both Nodal and BMP signaling, was down-regulated following inhibition of Nodal-Smad2 signaling, the contribution of Smad7 to the cross-talk between the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 pathways in ES cells was examined. Biochemical manipulation of Smad7 expression, through shRNA knockdown or inducible gene expression, significantly reduced the SB431542-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1/5 and induction of the Id genes. We conclude that autocrine Nodal signaling in undifferentiated mouse ES cells modulates the vital pluripotency pathway of BMP signaling.",

ES (embryonic stem) cell lines are derived from the epiblast of pre-implantation embryos and like the inner cell mass cells from which they are derived exhibit the remarkable property of pluripotency, namely the ability to differentiate into all cell lineages comprising the adult organism. ES cells and their differentiated progeny offer tremendous potential to regenerative medicine, particularly as cellular therapies for the treatment of a wide variety of chronic disorders, such as Type 1 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and retinal degeneration. In order for this potential to be realized, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating the fundamental properties of ES cells, i.e. pluripotency, proliferation and differentiation, is required.

        "abstract": "The roles of TGF-\u03b2 family members in the maintenance and differentiation of ES cells, somatic stem cells, and cancer stem cells are illustrated. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2s and their family members, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), Nodal and activins, have been implicated in the development and maintenance of various organs, in which stem cells play important roles. Stem cells are characterized by their ability to self-renew and to generate differentiated cells of a particular tissue, and are classified into embryonic and somatic stem cells. Embryonic stem (ES) cells self-renew indefinitely and contribute to derivatives of all three primary germ layers. In contrast, somatic stem cells, which can be identified in various adult organs, exhibit limited abilities for self-renewal and differentiation in most cases. The multi-lineage differentiation capacity of ES cells and somatic stem cells has opened possibilities for cell replacement therapies for genetic, malignant and degenerative diseases. In order to utilize stem cells for therapeutic applications, it is essential to understand the extrinsic and intrinsic factors regulating self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells. More recently, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been generated from mouse and human fibroblasts that resemble ES cells via ectopic expression of four transcription factors. iPS cells may have an advantage in regenerative medicine, since they overcome the immunogenicity and ethical controversy of ES cells. Moreover, recent studies have highlighted the involvement of cancer stem cells during the formation and progression of various types of cancers, including leukemia, glioma, and breast cancer. Here, we illustrate the roles of TGF-\u03b2 family members in the maintenance and differentiation of ES cells, somatic stem cells, and cancer stem cells.",

Murine embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cell lines established directly from the early embryo1,2 which can contribute differentiated progeny to all adult tissues, including the germ-cell lineage3, after re-incorporation into the normal embryo. They provide both a cellular vector for the generation of transgenic animals4 and a useful system for the identification of polypeptide factors controlling differentiation processes in early development5. In particular, medium conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells contains a polypeptide factor, ES cell differentiation inhibitory activity (DIA), which specifically suppresses the spontaneous differentiation of ES cells in vitro, thereby permitting their growth as homogeneous stem cell populations in the absence of heterologous feeder cells6. ES cell pluripotentiality, including the ability to give rise to functional gametes, is preserved after prolonged culture in Buffalo rat liver media as a source of DIA7. Here, we report that purified DIA is related in structure and function to the recently identified haemopoetic regulatory factors human interleukin for DA cells8,9 and leukaemia inhibitory factor10. DIA and human interleukin DA/leukaemia inhibitory factor have thus been identified as related multifunctional regulatory factors with distinct biological activities in both early embryonic and haemopoetic stem cell systems.",

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are considered to exist in a ground state if shielded from differentiation triggers. Here we show that FGF4 and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibitors, designated R2i, not only provide the ground state pluripotency in production and maintenance of na\u00efve ES cells from blastocysts of different mouse strains, but also maintain ES cells with higher genomic integrity following long-term cultivation compared with the chemical inhibition of the FGF4 and GSK3 pathways, known as 2i. Global transcriptome analysis of the ES cells highlights augmented BMP4 signaling pathway. The crucial role of the BMP4 pathway in maintaining the R2i ground state pluripotency is demonstrated by BMP4 receptor suppression, resulting in differentiation and cell death. In conclusion, by inhibiting TGF\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways, we introduce a novel defined approach to efficiently establish the ground state pluripotency.",

Pluripotency is defined as the capacity of individual cells to initiate all lineages of the mature organism in response to signals from the embryo or cell culture environment. A pluripotent cell has no predetermined programme; it is a blank slate. This is the foundation of mammalian development and of ES (embryonic stem) cell biology. What are the design principles of this na\u00efve cell state? How is pluripotency acquired and maintained? Suppressing activation of ERKs (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases) is critical to establishing and sustaining ES cells. Inhibition of GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) reinforces this effect. We review the effect of selective kinase inhibitors on pluripotent cells and consider how these effects are mediated. We propose that ES cells represent a ground state, meaning a basal proliferative state that is free of epigenetic restriction and has minimal requirements for extrinsic stimuli. The stability of this state is reflected in the homogeneity of ES cell populations cultured in the presence of small-molecule inhibitors of MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase) and GSK3.",

        "abstract": "The role of major transcription factors, signaling pathways, small molecular compounds, epigenetic regulators, non-coding RNAs, and cellular energetics in ESC\u2019s self-renewal is focused on. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are a type of cells capable of self-renewal and multi-directional differentiation. The self-renewal of ESCs is regulated by factors including signaling pathway proteins, transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, cytokines, and small molecular compounds. Similarly, non-coding RNAs, small RNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) also play an important role in the process. Functionally, the core transcription factors interact with helper transcription factors to activate the expression of genes that contribute to maintaining pluripotency, while suppressing the expression of differentiation-related genes. Additionally, cytokines such as leukemia suppressor factor (LIF) stimulate downstream signaling pathways and promote self-renewal of ESCs. Particularly, LIF binds to its receptor (LIFR/gp130) to trigger the downstream Jak-Stat3 signaling pathway. BMP4 activates the downstream pathway and acts in combination with Jak-Stat3 to promote pluripotency of ESCs in the absence of serum. In addition, activation of the Wnt-FDZ signaling pathway has been observed to facilitate the self-renewal of ESCs. Small molecule modulator proteins of the pathway mentioned above are widely used in in vitro culture of stem cells. Multiple epigenetic regulators are involved in the maintenance of ESCs self-renewal, making the epigenetic status of ESCs a crucial factor in this process. Similarly, non-coding RNAs and cellular energetics have been described to promote the maintenance of the ESC\u2019s self-renewal. These factors regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of ESCs by forming signaling networks. This review focused on the role of major transcription factors, signaling pathways, small molecular compounds, epigenetic regulators, non-coding RNAs, and cellular energetics in ESC\u2019s self-renewal.",

During embryonic development, cells gradually restrict their developmental potential as they exit pluripotency and differentiate into various cell types. The POU transcription factor Oct4 (encoded by Pou5f1) lies at the center of the pluripotency machinery that regulates stemness and differentiation in stem cells, and is required for reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Several studies have revealed that Oct4 and other stemness genes are also expressed in multipotent cell populations such as neural crest cells (NCCs), and are required to expand the NCC developmental potential. Transcriptional regulation of Oct4 has been studied extensively in stem cells during early embryonic development and reprogramming, but not in NCCs. Here, we review how Oct4 is regulated in pluripotent stem cells, and address some of the gaps in knowledge about regulation of the pluripotency network in NCCs.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism of HOX gene regulation in stem cells may provide new ways to manipulate stem cell fate and function leading to improved and new approaches in the field of regenerative medicine. Stem cells display a unique cell type within the body that has the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into specialized cell types. Compared to pluripotent stem cells, adult stem cells (ASC) such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit restricted differentiation capabilities that are limited to cell types typically found in the tissue of origin, which implicates that there must be a certain code or priming determined by the tissue of origin. HOX genes, a subset of homeobox genes encoding transcription factors that are generally repressed in undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells, emerged here as master regulators of cell identity and cell fate during embryogenesis, and in maintaining this positional identity throughout life as well as specifying various regional properties of respective tissues. Concurrently, intricate molecular circuits regulated by diverse stem cell-typical signaling pathways, balance stem cell maintenance, proliferation and differentiation. However, it still needs to be unraveled how stem cell-related signaling pathways establish and regulate ASC-specific HOX expression pattern with different temporal-spatial topography, known as the HOX code. This comprehensive review therefore summarizes the current knowledge of specific ASC-related HOX expression patterns and how these were integrated into stem cell-related signaling pathways.

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that an FGFR/AKT/SOX2 axis controls cancer stemness in PDAC and therefore may represent an important therapeutic target in the fight against this very aggressive form of cancer. Cancer stemness is associated with high malignancy and low differentiation, as well as therapeutic resistance of tumors including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) exert pleiotropic effects on a variety of cellular processes and functions including embryonic stem cell pluripotency and cancer cell stemness via the activation of four tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs). FGF ligands have been a major component of the cocktail of growth factors contained in the cancer stemness-inducing (CSI) and organoid culture medium. Although FGF/FGFR signaling has been hypothesized to maintain cancer stemness, its function in this process is still unclear. We report that inhibition of FGF/FGFR signaling impairs sphere-forming ability of PDAC in vitro, and knocking down FGFR1 and FGFR2 decreased their tumorigenesis abilities in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that SOX2 is down-regulated upon loss of FGFR signaling. The overexpression of SOX2 in SOX2-negative cells, which normally do not display stemness capabilities, is sufficient to induce spheroid formation. Additionally, we found that AKT phosphorylation was reduced upon FGFR signaling inhibition. The inhibition of AKT using specific pharmacological inhibitors in the context of CSI medium leads to the loss of spheroid formation associated with loss of SOX2 nuclear expression and increased degradation. We demonstrate that an FGFR/AKT/SOX2 axis controls cancer stemness in PDAC and therefore may represent an important therapeutic target in the fight against this very aggressive form of cancer.",

Stem cells are invaluable resources for personalized medicine. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received great attention as therapeutic tools due to being a safe, ethical, and accessible option with immunomodulatory and controlled differentiation properties. Apelin receptor (Aplnr) signaling is reported to be involved in biological events, including gastrulation, mesoderm migration, proliferation of MSCs. However, the knowledge about the exact role and mechanism of Aplnr signaling during mesoderm and MSCs differentiation is still primitive. The current study aims to unveil the role of Aplnr signaling during mesoderm and MSC differentiation from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) through peptide/small molecule activation, overexpression, knock down or CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock out of the pathway components. Morphological changes, gene and protein expression analysis, including antibody array, LC/MS, mRNA/miRNA sequencing, reveal that Aplnr signaling promotes mesoderm commitment possibly via EGFR and TGF\u2010beta signaling pathways and enhances migration of cells during mesoderm differentiation. Moreover, Aplnr signaling positively regulates MSCs differentiation from hPSCs and increases MSC characteristics and differentiation capacity by regulating pathways, such as EGFR, TGF\u03b2, Wnt, PDGF, and FGF. Osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic differentiations are significantly enhanced with Aplnr signaling activity. This study generates an important foundation to generate high potential MSCs from PSCs to be used in personalized cell therapy.",

Background The scarcity of pluripotent stem cells poses a major challenge to the clinical application, given ethical and biosafety considerations. While germline stem cells commit to gamete differentiation throughout life, studies demonstrated the spontaneous acquisition of pluripotency by spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) from neonatal testes at a low frequency (1 in 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910^7). Notably, this process occurs without exogenous oncogenes or chemical supplementation. However, while knockout of the p53 gene accelerates the transformation of SSCs, it also increases risk and hampers their clinical use. Results We report a transformation system that efficiently and stably convert SSCs into pluripotent stem cells around 10 passages with the morphology similar to that of epiblast stem cells, which convert to embryonic stem (ES) cell-like colonies after change with ES medium. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and fresh mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder (MEF) are essential for transformation, and addition of 2i (CHIR99021 and PD0325901) further enhanced the pluripotency. Transcriptome analysis revealed that EGF activated the RAS signaling pathway and inhibited p38 to initiate transformation, and synergically cooperated with LIF to promote the transformation. Conclusion This system established an efficient and safe resource of pluripotent cells from autologous germline, and provide new avenues for regenerative medicine and animal cloning.",

Over the last 2 decades, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have had various potential applications in various medical research areas, from personalized medicine to disease treatment. Different cellular resources are accessible for iPSC generation, such as keratinocytes, skin fibroblasts, and blood or urine cells. However, all these sources are somatic cells, and we must make several changes in a somatic cell\u2019s transcriptome and chromatin state to become a pluripotent cell. It has recently been revealed that cancer cells can be a new source of iPSCs production. Cancer cells show similarities with iPSCs in self-renewal capacity, reprogramming potency, and signaling pathways. Although genetic abnormalities and potential tumor formation in cancer cells pose a severe risk, reprogrammed cancer-induced pluripotent stem cells (cancer-iPSCs) indicate that pluripotency can transiently overcome the cancer phenotype.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a large family of secretory molecules that act through tyrosine kinase receptors known as FGF receptors. They play crucial roles in a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, morphogenesis, and differentiation, as well as in tissue repair and regeneration. The signaling pathways regulated by FGFs include RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)\u2013protein kinase B (AKT), phospholipase C gamma (PLC\u03b3), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). To date, 22 FGFs have been discovered, involved in different functions in the body. Several FGFs directly or indirectly interfere with repair during tissue regeneration, in addition to their critical functions in the maintenance of pluripotency and dedifferentiation of stem cells. In this review, we summarize the roles of FGFs in diverse cellular processes and shed light on the importance of FGF signaling in mechanisms of tissue repair and regeneration.",

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can self-renew indefinitely to generate cells like themselves with a normal karyotype and differentiate into other types of cells when stimulated with a proper set of internal and external signals. hPSCs including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an alternative approach toward stem cell biology, drug discovery, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine. hESCs are commonly derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos and can maintain their pluripotency in appropriate culture media. The Hippo pathway is a major integrator of cell surface-mediated signals and plays an essential role in regulating hESCs function. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and TAZ (PDZ binding motif) are critical downstream transcriptional coactivators in the Hippo pathway. The culture conditions have effects on the cytoplasmic or nuclear YAP/TAZ localization. Also, the activity of Hippo pathway is influenced by cell density, mechanical tension, and biochemical signals. In this review article, we summarize the function of YAP/TAZ and focus on the regulation of YAP/TAZ in self-renewal and differentiation of hESCs.",

Xenopus egg extract is a powerful material to modify cultured cells fate and to induce cellular reprogramming in mammals. In this study, the response of goldfish fin cells to in vitro exposure to Xenopus egg extract, and subsequent culture, was studied using a cDNA microarray approach, gene ontology and KEGG pathways analyses, and qPCR validation. We observed that several actors of the TGF\u03b2 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways, as well as some mesenchymal markers, were inhibited in treated cells, while several epithelial markers were upregulated. This was associated with morphological changes of the cells in culture, suggesting that egg extract drove cultured fin cells towards a mesenchymal-epithelial transition. This indicates that Xenopus egg extract treatment relieved some barriers of somatic reprogramming in fish cells. However, the lack of re-expression of pou2 and nanog pluripotency markers, the\u00a0absence of DNA methylation remodeling of their promoter region, and the strong decrease in de novo lipid biosynthesis metabolism, indicate that reprogramming was only partial. The observed changes may render these treated cells more suitable for studies on in vivo reprogramming after somatic cell nuclear transfer.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive and uncontrolled gradual loss of motor neurons function or death of neuron cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and the mechanisms underlying their progressive nature remain elusive. There is urgent need to investigate therapeutic strategies and novel treatments for neural regeneration in disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, the development and identification of pluripotent stem cells enabling the acquisition of a large number of neural cells in order to improve cell recovery after neurodegenerative disorders. Pluripotent stem cells which consist of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are characterized by their ability to indefinitely self-renew and the capacity to differentiate into different types of cells. The first human ESC lines were established from donated human embryos; while, because of a limited supply of donor embryos, human ESCs derivation remains ethically and politically controversial. Hence, hiPSCs-based therapies have been shown as an effective replacement for human ESCs without embryo destruction. Compared to the invasive methods for derivation of human ESCs, human iPSCs has opened possible to reprogram patient-specific cells by defined factors and with minimally invasive procedures. Human pluripotent stem cells are a good source for cell-based research, cell replacement therapies and disease modeling. To date, hundreds of human ESC and human iPSC lines have been generated with the aim of treating various neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we have highlighted the recent potentials, advances, and limitations of human pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "abstract": "The in vitro production of human iPSC-derived RBCs can be an alternative treatment option for patients with blood disorders and an overview of the current status and applications of this field is presented. During the last years, several strategies have been made to obtain mature erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) from the bone marrow or umbilical cord blood (UCB). However, UCB-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are a limited source and in vitro large-scale expansion of RBC from HSC remains problematic. One promising alternative can be human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) that provide an unlimited source of cells. Human PSCs, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are self-renewing progenitors that can be differentiated to lineages of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Several previous studies have revealed that human ESCs can differentiate into functional oxygen-carrying erythrocytes; however, the ex vivo expansion of human ESC-derived RBC is subjected to ethical concerns. Human iPSCs can be a suitable therapeutic choice for the in vitro/ex vivo manufacture of RBCs. Reprogramming of human somatic cells through the ectopic expression of the transcription factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC, LIN28, and NANOG) has provided a new avenue for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. Various techniques have been developed to generate enucleated RBCs from human iPSCs. The in vitro production of human iPSC-derived RBCs can be an alternative treatment option for patients with blood disorders. In this review, we focused on the generation of human iPSC-derived erythrocytes to present an overview of the current status and applications of this field.",

Osteoarthritis (OA) as a degenerative joint disease is the most common form of joint disorder that causes pain, stiffness, and other symptoms associated with OA. Various genetic, biomechanical, and environmental factors have a relevant role in the development of OA. To date, extensive efforts are currently used to overcome the poor self-healing capacity of articular cartilage. Despite the pivotal role of chondrocytes, their proliferation and repair capacity after tissue injury are limited. Therefore, the development of new strategies to overcome these constraints is urgently needed. Recent advances in regenerative medicine suggest that pluripotent stem cells are promising stem cell sources for cartilage repair. Pluripotent stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have the capacity to differentiate into different types of cells and can self-renew indefinitely. In the past few decades, numerous attempts have been made to regenerate articular cartilage by using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The potential applications of patient-specific iPSCs hold great promise for regenerative medicine and OA treatment. However, there are different culture conditions for the preparation and characterization of human iPSCs-derived chondrocytes (hiChondrocytes). Recent biochemical analyses reported that several paracrine factors such as TGFb, BMPs, WNT, Ihh, and Runx have been shown to be involved in cartilage cell proliferation and differentiation from human iPSCs. In this review, we summarize and discuss the paracrine interactions involved in human iPSCs differentiation into chondrocytes in different cell culture media.",

Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is one of the main diseases causing female infertility that happens in about 1% of women between 30-40 years old. There are few effective methods for the treatment of women with POI. In the past few years, stem cell-based therapy as one of the most highly investigated new therapies has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of POI. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can self-renew indefinitely and differentiate into any type of cell. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a type of pluripotent stem cells are the most powerful candidate for the treatment of POI. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are derived from adult somatic cells by treatment with exogenous defined factors to create an embryonic-like pluripotent state. Both hiPSCs and hESCs can proliferate and give rise to ectodermal, mesodermal, endodermal, and germ cell lineages. After ovarian stimulation, the number of available oocytes is limited and the yield of total oocytes with high quality is low. Therefore, a robust and reproducible in-vitro culture system that supports the differentiation of human oocytes from PSCs is necessary. Very few studies have focused on the derivation of oocyte-like cells from hiPSCs and the details of hPSCs differentiation into oocytes have not been fully investigated. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the differentiation potential of hPSCs into human oocyte-like cells.",

Chicken iPSCs have been a useful tool for the production of transgenic birds and viral vaccines. Despite the benefits and multiple applications of chicken pluripotent stem cells, the propagation of these cells is limited and some important challenges should be eliminated before their use in vaccine manufacturing. It is necessary to define the appropriate culture conditions for chicken pluripotent stem cells. For example, the presence of endogenous viruses in the avian species should be evaluated for human vaccine production. Currently, primary chicken fibroblast cells are still mainly used for vaccine production. This review covers the resources to achieve chicken derived cell lines for vaccine manufacturing. Abstract",

The Jumonji domain-containing protein-3 (JMJD3) is a histone demethylase that regulates the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3). H3K27me3 is an important epigenetic event associated with transcriptional silencing. JMJD3 has been studied extensively in immune diseases, cancer, and tumor development. There is a comprehensive epigenetic transformation during the transition of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into specialized cells or the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Recent studies have illustrated that JMJD3 plays a major role in cell fate determination of pluripotent and multipotent stem cells (MSCs). JMJD3 has been found to enhance self-renewal ability and reduce the differentiation capacity of ESCs and MSCs. In this review, we will focus on the recent advances of JMJD3 function in stem cell fate. Video Abstract",

Spinal cord injury (SCI) as a serious public health issue and neurological insult is one of the most causes of long-term disability. To date, a variety of techniques have been widely developed to treat central nervous system injury. Currently, clinical treatments are limited to surgical decompression and pharmacotherapy. Because of their negative effects and inefficiency, novel therapeutic approaches in the management of SCI are required. Improvement and innovation of stem cell-based therapies have allowed a huge potential for biological and future clinical applications. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are defined by their abilities to divide asymmetrically, self-renew and ultimately differentiate into various cell lineages. There are considerable research efforts to use various types of stem cells such as ESCs, neural stem cells (NSCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the treatment of patients with SCI. Moreover, the use of patient-specific iPSCs hold great potential as an unlimited cell source for generating in vivo models of SCI. In this review we focused on the potential of hPSCs in treating SCI.",

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great value for future clinical applications. However, standard culture conditions maintain hESCs in a primed state, which bears heterogeneity in pluripotency and a tendency for spontaneous differentiation. To counter these drawbacks, primed hESCs have been converted to a naive state, but this has restricted the efficiency of existing directed differentiation protocols. In mouse, WNT inhibition by inhibitor of WNT production-2, together with a higher dose of fibroblast growth factor 2 (12\u2009ng/mL) in DMEM/F12 basal medium (DhiFI), markedly improved derivation and maintenance of primed mouse epiblast stem cells. In this study, we show that DhiFI conditions similarly improved primed hESC traits, such as conferring a primed transcriptional signature with high levels of pluripotency markers and reduced levels of differentiation markers. When triggered to differentiate to neuronal and cardiac lineages, DhiFI hESCs and isogenic primed hESCs progressed similarly. Moreover, DhiFI conditions supported the derivation of hESC lines from a post-inner cell mass intermediate (PICMI). DhiFI-derived hESCs showed less spontaneous differentiation and expressed significantly lower levels of lineage-specific markers, compared to primed-derived lines from the same PICMI. Overall, DhiFI hESCs retained advantages of both primed and naive pluripotency and may ultimately represent a more favorable starting point for differentiation toward clinically desired cell types.",

Abstract While Mek1/2 and Gsk3\u03b2 inhibition (\u201c2i\u201d) supports the maintenance of murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in a homogenous na\u00efve state, prolonged culture in 2i results in aneuploidy and DNA hypomethylation that impairs developmental potential. Additionally, 2i fails to support derivation and culture of fully potent female ESCs. Here we find that mouse ESCs cultured in 2i/LIF supplemented with lipid-rich albumin (AlbuMAX) undergo pluripotency transition yet maintain genomic stability and full potency over long-term culture. Mechanistically, lipids in AlbuMAX impact intracellular metabolism including nucleotide biosynthesis, lipid biogenesis, and TCA cycle intermediates, with enhanced expression of DNMT3s that prevent DNA hypomethylation. Lipids induce a formative-like pluripotent state through direct stimulation of Erk2 phosphorylation, which also alleviates X chromosome loss in female ESCs. Importantly, both male and female \u201call-ESC\u201d mice can be generated from de novo derived ESCs using AlbuMAX-based media. Our findings underscore the importance of lipids to pluripotency and link nutrient cues to genome integrity in early development.",

Derivation of primed and na\u00efve human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have prompted an increased interest in devising culture conditions for maintaining their pluripotency and differential potential. Na\u00efve ESCs are characterized by improved viability, proliferation, and differentiation capacity in comparison to primed ESCs. However, traditional two-dimensional (2-D) cell culture techniques fail to mimic the three-dimensional (3-D) in vivo microenvironment, which results in altered morphological and molecular characteristics of ESCs. Here, we describe the use of 3-D self-assembling scaffolds that support growth and maintenance of the na\u00efve state characteristics of human ESC line, Elf1. Scaffolds were formed via a Michael addition reaction upon combination of two 8-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers functionalized with thiol (PEG-8-SH) and acrylate (PEG-8-Acr) end groups. 3-D scaffolds not only maintained the na\u00efve state, but also supported long-term growth for up to 3 weeks without requiring routine passaging and manipulation. 3-D grown cells exhibited upregulation of core (OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2) and na\u00efve (KLF17, KLF4, TFCP2L1, DPPA3, and DNMT3L) genes. These genes returned to normal levels when 3-D grown cells were propagated under 2-D culture conditions. Examination of RNA-sequencing demonstrated significant changes in gene expression profiles between 2-D and 3-D grown Elf1 cells. Gene Ontology analysis revealed upregulation of biological processes involved in the regulation of transcription and translation, as well as \u03b2-catenin-TCF complex assembly, extracellular matrix organization, and chromatin remodeling in 3-D grown Elf1 cells. 3-D culture conditions also induced upregulation of genes associated with several signaling pathways including Wnt signaling and focal adhesion. However, p53 signaling pathway associated genes were downregulated under these culture conditions. Our findings provide insight into the possible mechanisms of prolonged self-renewal as well as upregulation of pluripotent genes stimulated by the transduction of mechanical signals from the 3-D microenvironment.",

Over the past two decades, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have gained attention due to their pluripotent and proliferative ability which enables production of almost all cell types in the human body in vitro and makes them an excellent tool to study human embryogenesis and disease, as well as for drug discovery and cell transplantation therapies. Discovery of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) further expanded therapeutic applications of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). hPSCs provide a stable and unlimited original cell source for producing suitable cells and tissues for downstream applications. Therefore, engineering the environment in which these cells are grown, for stable and quality-controlled hPSC maintenance and production, is one of the key factors governing the success of these applications. hPSCs are maintained in a particular niche using specific cell culture components. Ideally, the culture should be free of xenobiotic components to render hPSCs suitable for therapeutic applications. Substantial efforts have been put to identify effective components, and develop culture conditions and protocols, for their large-scale expansion without compromising on quality. In this review, we discuss different media, their components and functions, including specific requirements to maintain the pluripotent and proliferative ability of hPSCs. Understanding the role of culture components would enable the development of appropriate conditions to promote large-scale, quality-controlled expansion of hPSCs thereby increasing their potential applications.",

        "abstract": "Although the PICMI is transcriptionally similar to the hESC profile and distinct from ICM, it exhibits upregulation of primordial germ cell (PGC) markers, dependence on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling,Upregulation of na\u00efve pluripotency-specific signaling networks and appears to be an intermediate switching point from na\u00efve to primed pluripOTency. STUDY QUESTION\nWhat are the transcriptional changes occurring during the human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derivation process, from the inner cell mass (ICM) to post-ICM intermediate stage (PICMI) to hESC stage, that have downstream effects on pluripotency states and differentiation?\n\n\nSUMMARY ANSWER\nWe reveal that although the PICMI is transcriptionally similar to the hESC profile and distinct from ICM, it exhibits upregulation of primordial germ cell (PGC) markers, dependence on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling, upregulation of na\u00efve pluripotency-specific signaling networks and appears to be an intermediate switching point from na\u00efve to primed pluripotency.\n\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY\nIt is currently known that the PICMI exhibits markers of early and late-epiblast stage. It is suggested that hESCs acquire primed pluripotency features due to the upregulation of post-implantation genes in the PICMI which renders them predisposed towards differentiation cues. Despite this current knowledge, the transcriptional landscape changes during hESC derivation from ICM to hESC and the effect of PICMI on pluripotent state is still not well defined.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION\nTo gain insight into the signaling mechanisms that may govern the ICM to PICMI to hESC transition, comparative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed on preimplantation ICMs, PICMIs and hESCs in biological and technical triplicates (n = 3).\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, AND METHODS\nPrimed hESCs (XX) were maintained in feeder-free culture conditions on Matrigel for two passages and approximately 50 cells were collected in biological and technical triplicates (n = 3). For ICM sample collection, Day 3, frozen-thawed human embryos were cultured up to day five blastocyst stage and only good quality blastocysts were subjected to laser-assisted micromanipulation for ICM collection (n = 3). Next, day six expanded blastocysts were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts and manual dissection was performed on the PICMI outgrowths between post-plating Day 6 and Day 10 (n = 3). Sequencing of these samples was performed on NextSeq500 and statistical analysis was performed using edgeR (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05).\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE\nComparative RNA-seq data analysis revealed that 634 and 560 protein-coding genes were significantly up and downregulated in hESCs compared to ICM (FDR < 0.05), respectively. Upon ICM to PICMI transition, 471 genes were expressed significantly higher in the PICMI compared to ICM, while 296 genes were elevated in the ICM alone (FDR < 0.05). Principle component analysis showed that the ICM was completely distinct from the PICMI and hESCs while the latter two clustered in close proximity to each other. Increased expression of E-CADHERIN1 (CDH1) in ICM and intermediate levels in the PICMI was observed, while CDH2 was higher in hESCs, suggesting a role of extracellular matrix components in facilitating pluripotency transition during hESC derivation. The PICMI also showed regulation of na\u00efve-specific LIF and bone morphogenetic protein signaling, differential regulation of primed pluripotency-specific fibroblast growth factor and NODAL signaling pathway components, upregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (PI3K/AKT/mTORC), as well as predisposition towards the germ cell lineage, further confirmed by gene ontology analysis. Hence, the data suggest that the PICMI may serve as an intermediate pluripotency stage which, when subjected to an appropriate culture niche, could aid in enhancing na\u00efve hESC derivation and germ cell differentiation efficiency.\n\n\nLARGE-SCALE DATA\nGene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Accession number GSE119378.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\nOwing to the limitation in sample availability, the sex of ICM and PICMI have not been taken into consideration. Obtaining cells from the ICM and maintaining them in culture is not feasible as it will hamper the formation of PICMI and hESC derivation. Single-cell quantitative real-time PCR on low ICM and PICMI cell numbers, although challenging due to limited availability of human embryos, will be advantageous to further corroborate the RNA-seq data on transcriptional changes during hESC derivation process.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\nWe elucidate the dynamics of transcriptional network changes from the na\u00efve ICM to the intermediate PICMI stage and finally the primed hESC lines. We provide an in-depth understanding of the PICMI and its role in conferring the type of pluripotent state which may have important downstream effects on differentiation, specifically towards the PGC lineage. This knowledge contributes to our limited understanding of the true nature of the human pluripotent state in vitro.\n\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)\nThis research is supported by the Concerted Research Actions funding from Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds University Ghent (BOF GOA 01G01112).The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

The derivation of gametes from patient-specific pluripotent stem cells may provide new perspectives for genetic parenthood for patients currently facing sterility. We use current data to assess the gamete differentiation potential of patient-specific pluripotent stem cells and to determine which reprogramming strategy holds the greatest promise for future clinical applications. First, we compare the two best established somatic cell reprogramming strategies: the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and somatic cell nuclear transfer followed by embryonic stem cell derivation (SCNT-ESC). Recent reports have indicated that these stem cells, though displaying a similar pluripotency potential, show important differences at the epigenomic level, which may have repercussions on their applicability. By comparing data on the genetic and epigenetic stability of these cell types during derivation and in-vitro culture, we assess the reprogramming efficiency of both technologies and possible effects on the subsequent differentiation potential of these cells. Moreover, we discuss possible implications of mitochondrial heteroplasmy. We also address the ethical aspects of both cell types, as well as the safety considerations associated with clinical applications using these cells, e.g. the known genomic instability of human PSCs during long-term culture. Secondly, we discuss the role of the stem cell pluripotency state in germ cell differentiation. In mice, success in germ cell development from pluripotent stem cells could only be achieved when starting from a naive state of pluripotency. It remains to be investigated if the naive state is also crucial for germ cell differentiation in human cells and to what extent human naive pluripotency resembles the naive state in mouse.",

The maintenance and expansion of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in two-dimensional (2-D) culture is technically challenging, requiring routine manipulation and passaging. We developed three-dimensional (3-D) scaffolds to mimic the in vivo microenvironment for stem cell proliferation. The scaffolds were made of two 8-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers functionalized with thiol (PEG-8-SH) and acrylate (PEG-8-Acr) end groups, which self-assembled via a Michael addition reaction. When primed ESCs (H9 cells) were mixed with PEG polymers, they were encapsulated and grew for an extended period, while maintaining their viability, self-renewal, and differentiation potential both in vitro and in vivo. Three-dimensional (3-D) self-assembling scaffold-grown cells displayed an upregulation of core pluripotency genes, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2. In addition, the expression of primed markers decreased, while the expression of na\u00efve markers substantially increased. Interestingly, the expression of mechanosensitive genes, YAP and TAZ, was also upregulated. YAP inhibition by Verteporfin abrogated the increased expression of YAP/TAZ as well as core and na\u00efve pluripotent markers. Evidently, the 3-D culture conditions induced the upregulation of makers associated with a na\u00efve state of pluripotency in the primed cells. Overall, our 3-D culture system supported the expansion of a homogenous population of ESCs and should be helpful in advancing their use for cell therapy and regenerative medicine.",

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are conventionally maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers. However, downstream applications, such as directed differentiation protocols, are primarily optimized for feeder-free cultures. Therefore, hPSCs must often be adapted to feeder-free conditions. Here we propose a novel feeder-free adaptation protocol using StemFlex medium, which can be directly applied to thawed hPSC lines. The direct feeder-free adaptation protocol using StemFlex culture medium on Geltrex coating led to robust hPSC cultures in approximately 2 weeks. This approach was tested with three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines. All lines were confirmed to be pluripotent, expressing POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG. No chromosomal imbalances were induced by the feeder-free adaptation. StemFlex medium enabled the efficient adaptation of hPSCs to feeder-free conditions directly after thawing. This protocol is easy to implement in laboratories that perform feeder-free cultures, allowing more convenient adaptation and more robust expansion of cryopreserved hPSCs, even in cases when sample quality is low or unknown.",

Activin/Nodal signaling is required for maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal of mouse epiblast stem cells and human embryonic stem cells (hESC). In this study, we investigated whether this signaling mechanism is also operative in cultured epiblasts derived from Days 10.5-12 pig embryos. Pig epiblast stem cell lines (pEpiSC) were established on mouse feeder layers and medium supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). pEpiSC express the core pluripotency factors OCT4 (or POU5F1), NANOG, SOX2, and NODAL, but they do not express REX1 or alkaline phosphatase activity. Blocking leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/JAK/STAT3 pathway by adding the specific JAK I inhibitor 420099 and an anti-LIF antibody over 3 passages did not affect pluripotency of pEpiSC. In contrast, cells grown with the Alk-5 inhibitor SB431542, which blocks Activin/Nodal pathway, differentiated readily toward the neural lineage. pEpiSC are pluripotent, as established by their differentiation potential to ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. These cells can be induced to differentiate toward trophectoderm and to germ cell precursors in response to bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that pig epiblasts express the core pluripotency genes and that the capacity for maintaining self-renewal in pEpiSC depends on Activin/Nodal signaling. This study provides further evidence that maintenance of pluripotency via Activin/Nodal signal is conserved in mammals.",

        "abstract": "It is suggested that endogenously activated autocrine loops of activin-Nodal signaling promote ES cell self-renewal. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are self-renewing cells that maintain pluripotency to differentiate into all types of cells. Because of their potential to provide a variety of tissues for use in regenerative medicine, there is great interest in the identification of growth factors that govern these unique properties of ES cells. However, the signaling pathways controlling ES cell proliferation remain largely unknown. Since transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) superfamily members have been implicated in the processes of early embryogenesis, we investigated their roles in ES cell self-renewal. Inhibition of activin-Nodal-TGF\u03b2 signaling by Smad7 or SB-431542 dramatically decreased ES cell proliferation without decreasing ES pluripotency. By contrast, inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by Smad6 did not exhibit such effects, suggesting that activin-Nodal-TGF\u03b2 signaling, but not BMP signaling, is indispensable for ES cell propagation. In serum-free culture, supplementation of recombinant activin or Nodal, but not TGF\u03b2 or BMP, significantly enhanced ES cell propagation without affecting pluripotency. We also found that activin-Nodal signaling was constitutively activated in an autocrine fashion in serum-free cultured ES cells, and that inhibition of such endogenous signaling by SB-431542 decreased ES cell propagation in serum-free conditions. These findings suggest that endogenously activated autocrine loops of activin-Nodal signaling promote ES cell self-renewal.",

Although the pig is considered an important model of human disease and an ideal animal for the preclinical testing of cell transplantation, the utility of this model has been hampered by a lack of genuine porcine embryonic stem cells. Here, we derived a porcine pluripotent stem cell (pPSC) line from day 5.5 blastocysts in a newly developed culture system based on MXV medium and a 5% oxygen atmosphere. The pPSCs had been passaged more than 75 times over two years, and the morphology of the colony was similar to that of human embryonic stem cells. Characterization and assessment showed that the pPSCs were alkaline phosphatase (AKP) positive, possessed normal karyotypes and expressed classic pluripotent markers, including OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG. In vitro differentiation through embryonic body formation and in vivo differentiation via teratoma formation in nude mice demonstrated that the pPSCs could differentiate into cells of the three germ layers. The pPSCs transfected with fuw-DsRed (pPSC-FDs) could be passaged with a stable expression of both DsRed and pluripotent markers. Notably, when pPSC-FDs were used as donor cells for somatic nuclear transfer, 11.52% of the reconstructed embryos developed into blastocysts, which was not significantly different from that of the reconstructed embryos derived from porcine embryonic fibroblasts. When pPSC-FDs were injected into day 4.5 blastocysts, they became involved in the in vitro embryonic development and contributed to the viscera of foetuses at day 50 of pregnancy as well as the developed placenta after the chimeric blastocysts were transferred into recipients. These findings indicated that the pPSCs were porcine pluripotent cells; that this would be a useful cell line for porcine genetic engineering and a valuable cell line for clarifying the molecular mechanism of pluripotency regulation in pigs.",

The pluripotent status of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) confers upon them the capacity to differentiate into the three primary germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, from which all the cells of the adult body are derived. An understanding of the mechanisms controlling pluripotency is thus essential for driving the differentiation of human pluripotent cells into cell types useful for clinical applications. The Activin/Nodal signalling pathway is necessary to maintain pluripotency in human ESCs and in mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), but the molecular mechanisms by which it achieves this effect remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that Activin/Nodal signalling controls expression of the key pluripotency factor Nanog in human ESCs and in mouse EpiSCs. Nanog in turn prevents neuroectoderm differentiation induced by FGF signalling and limits the transcriptional activity of the Smad2/3 cascade, blocking progression along the endoderm lineage. This negative-feedback loop imposes stasis in neuroectoderm and mesendoderm differentiation, thereby maintaining the pluripotent status of human ESCs and mouse EpiSCs.",

We recently derived mouse expanded potential stem cells (EPSCs) from individual blastomeres by inhibiting the critical molecular pathways that predispose their differentiation. EPSCs had enriched molecular signatures of blastomeres and possessed developmental potency for all embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages. Here, we report the derivation of porcine EPSCs, which express key pluripotency genes, are genetically stable, permit genome editing, differentiate to derivatives of the three germ layers in chimeras and produce primordial germ cell-like cells in vitro. Under similar conditions, human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells can be converted, or somatic cells directly reprogrammed, to EPSCs that display the molecular and functional attributes reminiscent of porcine EPSCs. Importantly, trophoblast stem-cell-like cells can be generated from both human and porcine EPSCs. Our pathway-inhibition paradigm thus opens an avenue for generating mammalian pluripotent stem cells, and EPSCs present a unique cellular platform for translational research in biotechnology and regenerative medicine. Gao, Nowak-Imialek, Chen et al. generate porcine and human stem cells that possess expanded developmental potency for both embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages.",

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are considered to exist in a ground state if shielded from differentiation triggers. Here we show that FGF4 and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibitors, designated R2i, not only provide the ground state pluripotency in production and maintenance of na\u00efve ES cells from blastocysts of different mouse strains, but also maintain ES cells with higher genomic integrity following long-term cultivation compared with the chemical inhibition of the FGF4 and GSK3 pathways, known as 2i. Global transcriptome analysis of the ES cells highlights augmented BMP4 signaling pathway. The crucial role of the BMP4 pathway in maintaining the R2i ground state pluripotency is demonstrated by BMP4 receptor suppression, resulting in differentiation and cell death. In conclusion, by inhibiting TGF\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways, we introduce a novel defined approach to efficiently establish the ground state pluripotency.",

Porcine induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) retain the enormous potential for farm animal reproduction and translational medicine, and have been reported by many laboratories worldwide. Some piPSC lines were bFGF\u2010dependence and showed mouse EpiSC\u2010like morphology; other lines were LIF\u2010dependence and showed mouse ESC\u2010like morphology. Metastable state of piPSC line that required both LIF and bFGF was also reported. Because bona fide pig embryonic stem cells were not available, uncovering piPSC state\u2010specific regulatory circuitries was the most important task. In this study, we explored the function of Activin\u2010SMAD signaling pathway and its downstream activated target genes in piPSCs. Transcriptome analysis showed that genes involved in Activin\u2010SMAD signaling pathway were evidently activated during porcine somatic cell reprogramming, regardless piPSCs were LIF\u2010 or bFGF\u2010dependent. Addition of Activin A and overexpression of SMAD2/3 significantly promoted expressions of porcine NANOG and OCT4, whereas inhibition of Activin\u2010SMAD signaling by SB431542 and SMAD7 reduced NANOG and OCT4 expressions, and induced piPSCs differentiation exiting from pluripotent state. Our data demonstrate that activation of Activin\u2010SMAD signaling pathway by addition of Activin A in culture medium is necessary for maintenance of self\u2010renewal in porcine pluripotent stem cells.",

        "abstract": "The results provide a molecular basis in porcine embryonic patterning and a clue for further studying porcines pluripotent regulatory networks. Background: Mammalian first lineage segregation generates trophectoderm (TE) and pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM), which provides an ideal model for studying the mechanisms of maintenance and loss of pluripotency. In mouse, the transcription factor OCT4 restricts to ICM and plays a key role in TE/ICM specification and pluripotent regulatory networks. However, in pig, OCT4 does not restrict to ICM cells, suggesting a different molecular basis in TE/ICM specification and pluripotent regulatory networks. Results: To explore molecular basis of porcine TE/ICM specification and pluripotent regulatory networks, we examined expression pattern of pluripotency factors, including SOX2, REX1, SALL4, ESG1, NANOG, TBX3, LIN28, KLF2, and KLF5, in porcine blastocysts. We found that SOX2 is a faithful pluripotent marker that anchored to the pluripotent cells including embryonic part cells, ICM cells and newly EPI cells along with developmental progress, whereas OCT4 expressed in almost all the cells at the same time. Consistently, analysis of spatiotemporal distribution of SOX2 and the TE marker CDX2 revealed an exclusive expression pattern in D6 blastocysts, whereas no correlation was observed between OCT4 and CDX2 at the same stage. Conclusions: Our results provide a molecular basis in porcine embryonic patterning and a clue for further studying porcine pluripotent regulatory networks.

        "abstract": "It is found that Fasudil or IDE1 alone could not achieve a similar effect as activin A, but on the contrary, CHIR99021 could efficiently promote definitive endoderm differentiation. Abstract Small molecules such as ROCK inhibitors (Fasudil) and inducer of definitive endoderm 1 (IDE1) can promote differentiation of definitive endoderm, but their effects remain controversial. Therefore, we attempted to verify the effect of these small molecules on promoting definitive endoderm differentiation and found that Fasudil or IDE1 alone could not achieve a similar effect as activin A. On the contrary, CHIR99021 could efficiently promote definitive endoderm differentiation. Nearly 43.4% of experimental cells were SRY-box transcription factor 17 (SOX17)-positive under the synergistic effect of IDE1 and CHIR99021, but its ability to differentiate towards definitive endoderm was still insufficient. Transcriptional analysis and comparison of IDE1 and CHIR99021 synergistic groups (IC) and activin A and CHIR99021 synergistic groups (AC) showed significantly down-regulated definitive endoderm markers in the IC group compared with those in the AC group and the differences between the two groups were mainly due to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP4) and fibroblast growth factor 17 (FGF17). Further single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed lower expression of BMP4 in SOX17-positive populations, while mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD) protein translation signal and FGF17 in the AC group were higher than that in the IC group. Western blot analysis showed a significant difference in levels of p-SMAD2/3 between AC and IC groups, which suggests that regulating p-SMAD2/3 may provide a reference to improve the differentiation of definitive endoderm.",

        "abstract": "A novel method of reprogramming mouse mature hepatocytes into murine endodermic progenitors (mEndoPCs) that express Lgr5, generate liver-specific organoids and can differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in vitro and give arise to bile duct structures and into functional hepatocytes in vivo is proposed. Hepatocytes cell-based transplantation is a promising strategy for treating liver diseases. However, there are still several limitations for their use in clinical applications among them the generation of highthrouput of functional hepatocytes, their life span in culture, the age of the donor age and the source of hepatic stem cells (SCs). At present, the challenge lies to develop approaches aiming the identification of the new molecular markers signaling pathways involved in the differentiation of SCs toward functional hepatocytes. In fact, Wnt(s) pathways governs multiple biological processes controlling the differentiation fate of SCs into hepatocytes, some of them result in the activation of small GTPase and the Lgr5 pathway regulators. Indeed, Lgr5 (a target gene of Wnt, the Leucine-rich-repeat-containing G protein-coupled Receptor 5) was shown to be crucial for maintaining long-term expansion of hepatic SC in vitro. In addition, Lgr5 primarily functions as an effector of the Cdc42 GTPases (a RhoGTPase protein, the cell division cycle 42). Higher activity of Cdc42 was reported to be correlated to hematopoietic SCs aging. However, this correlation has never been studied before in adipose tissue Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADSCs) which were proposed recently as a promising tool for liver regeneration.In this study, we were interested (i) to propose a novel method of reprogramming mouse mature hepatocytes into murine endodermic progenitors (mEndoPCs) that express Lgr5, generate liver-specific organoids and can differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in vitro and give arise to bile duct structures and into functional hepatocytes in vivo, and (ii) to study the activity of Cdc42 in human aged-derived hADSCs and the impact of its selective inhibition by ML141 on their hepatic differentiation potential in vitro.In our study we succeeded to generate mEndoPCs and to improve the functionality of the aged-hADSCs derived-hepatocytes. We showed that both Lgr5 and Cdc42 are regulated distinctly by Wnt signaling pathways. In addition, our results revealed that LIFR/STAT3 and LGR5/WNT pathways are important to maintain the unlimited expansion of mEndoPCs in vitro when STAT3 pathway is activated. MAPK/PKA, WNT/ \u03b2-catenin pathways and the exosome\u2019s production were shown to be deregulated with hADSCs aging. We showed also that a mesenchymal to epithelial transition was crucial to transdifferentiate hADSCs into functional hepatocytes. On the other side, ML141 is proposed as a new pharmacological tool to rejuvenate aged-hADSCs toward functionally younger-like cells thus by promoting cell proliferation, doubling and cell adherence. Finally, the transfer of these methodologies to human could serve the regenerative medicine of the liver as a good tool for hepatocyte-based drug toxicity screening systems and for the liver engineering using a \u00ab bio printing \u00bb approach.",

        "abstract": "The spontaneous differentiation technique could be a useful method for optimization of culture conditions to differentiate stem cells into specific cell types such ectoderm, neuron, endoderm and hepatocyte. Objective Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have the potential to give rise to all types of cells in the human body when appropriately induced to differentiate. Stem cells can differentiate spontaneously into the three-germ layer derivatives by embryoid bodies (EBs) formation. However, the two-dimensional (2D) adherent culture of hESCs under defined conditions is commonly used for directed differentiation toward a specific type of mature cells. In this study, we aimed to determine the propensity of the Royan hESC lines based on comparison of expression levels of 46 lineage specific markers. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, we have compared the expression of lineage-specific markers in hESC lines during EB versus adherent-based spontaneous differentiation. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to assess expressions of 46 lineage-specific markers in 4 hESC lines, Royan H1 (RH1), RH2, RH5, and RH6, during spontaneous differentiation in both EB and adherent cultures at 0, 10, and 30 days after initiation of differentiation. Results Based on qRT-PCR data analysis, the liver and neuronal markers had higher expression levels in EBs, whereas skin-specific markers expressed at higher levels in the adherent culture. The results showed differential expression patterns of some lineage-specific markers in EBs compared with the adherent cultures. Conclusion According to these results, possibly the spontaneous differentiation technique could be a useful method for optimization of culture conditions to differentiate stem cells into specific cell types such ectoderm, neuron, endoderm and hepatocyte. This approach might prove beneficial for further work on maximizing the efficiency of directed differentiation and development of novel differentiation protocols.",

Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this review is to provide an updated perspective on directing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to hepatocyte-like-cells (HLCs) and the associated challenges.Recent FindingsRecent advances in the hepatocyte differentiation field have largely been focused on increasing the reproducibility and definition of culture systems to further their translation to a clinical setting. There have been advances using new extracellular matrices such as human laminins, and recent work using small molecules to drive the differentiation process has dramatically reduced the cost of producing HLCs with equivalent phenotypes to growth factor-derived cells.SummaryThere are still several key aspects that remain unresolved, including the immature phenotype of hPSC-derived HLCs (a major hurdle for hPSC-derived progeny). Another key question is the zonal identity of the HLCs produced in vitro, which will have major implications in terms of disease modeling and drug metabolism. To date, there has been little investigation of this aspect of hepatic biology reported in the field.",

        "abstract": "The history of stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell technology in the context of hepatic differentiation is summarized and the potential applications the technology may offer for human liver disease modeling and treatment are discussed. Liver disease is a major global health concern. Liver cirrhosis is one of the leading causes of death in the world and currently the only therapeutic option for end\u2010stage liver disease (e.g., acute liver failure, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, cholestatic diseases, metabolic diseases, and malignant neoplasms) is orthotropic liver transplantation. Transplantation of hepatocytes has been proposed and used as an alternative to whole organ transplant to stabilize and prolong the lives of patients in some clinical cases. Although these experimental therapies have demonstrated promising and beneficial results, their routine use remains a challenge due to the shortage of donor livers available for cell isolation, variable quality of those tissues, the potential need for lifelong immunosuppression in the transplant recipient, and high costs. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies and more reliable clinical treatments are urgently needed. Recent and continuous technological advances in the development of stem cells suggest they may be beneficial in this respect. In this review, we summarize the history of stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology in the context of hepatic differentiation and discuss the potential applications the technology may offer for human liver disease modeling and treatment. This includes developing safer drugs and cell\u2010based therapies to improve the outcomes of patients with currently incurable health illnesses. We also review promising advances in other disease areas to highlight how the stem cell technology could be applied to liver diseases in the future. \u00a9 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have the capacity to differentiate into all mature blood cell types including megakaryocytes, providing a potential source to generate large-scale platelets to cope with the urgent clinical shortage. To generate platelets in large-scale in vitro , it is urgent to establish a highly efficient model and identify critical genes mediating the megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet generation. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq analysis in cord blood CD34+ cells collected from day 6 to day 10 after megakaryocytic differentiation and identified several signal pathways and transcriptional factors involved in this process. To explore the key regulators mediating megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet generation from hPSCs, we subsequently established a megakaryocytic differentiation system by co-culturing hPSCs with the mouse AGM-S3 (mAGM-S3) feeder cells and found that functional platelet could be generated. Through functional validation, we found that RUNX1 and ERG significantly promoted the generation of megakaryocytes and platelets from hPSCs. In conclusion, we established a highly efficient screening platform suitable for the identification of key regulators mediating megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet generation from hPSCs.

We show that combining a second related ligand, BMP4, in combination with Activin A yields 15%\u201320% more DE as compared with Activin A alone. The addition of recombinant BMP4 accelerates the downregulation of pluripotency genes, particularly SOX2, and results in upregulation of endogenous BMP2 and BMP4, which in turn leads to elevated levels of phospho\u2010SMAD1/5/8. Combined Activin A and BMP4 treatment also leads to an increase in the expression of DE genes CXCR4, SOX17, and FOXA2 when compared with Activin A addition alone. Comparative microarray studies between DE cells harvested on day 3 of differentiation further reveal a novel set of genes upregulated in response to initial BMP4 exposure. Several of these, including APLNR, LRIG3, MCC, LEPREL1, ROR2, and LZTS1, are expressed in the mouse primitive streak, the site of DE formation. Thus, this synergism between Activin A and BMP4 during the in vitro differentiation of hESC into DE suggests a complex interplay between BMP and Activin/Nodal signaling during the in vivo allocation and expansion of the endoderm lineage.

The cellular and molecular events regulating the induction and tissue-specific differentiation of endoderm are central to our understanding of the development and function of many organ systems. To define and characterize key components in this process, we have investigated the potential of embryonic stem (ES) cells to generate endoderm following their differentiation to embryoid bodies (EBs) in culture. We found that endoderm can be induced in EBs, either by limited exposure to serum or by culturing in the presence of activin A (activin) under serum-free conditions. By using an ES cell line with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA targeted to the brachyury locus, we demonstrate that endoderm develops from a brachyury+ population that also displays mesoderm potential. Transplantation of cells generated from activin-induced brachyury+ cells to the kidney capsule of recipient mice resulted in the development of endoderm-derived structures. These findings demonstrate that ES cells can generate endoderm in culture and, as such, establish this differentiation system as a unique murine model for studying the development and specification of this germ layer.",

        "abstract": "It is hypothesized that culturing mouse embryonic stem cells under simulated microgravity conditions in rotary bioreactors (BRs) will enhance the induction of directed DE differentiation, and the advantage of dynamic cultures in BRs to specifically enhance directedDE differentiation is indicated. Directed in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells towards definitive endoderm (DE) offers great research and therapeutic potential since these cells can further differentiate into cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as associated organs such as pancreas, liver, and thyroid. We hypothesized that culturing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) under simulated microgravity (SMG) conditions in rotary bioreactors (BRs) will enhance the induction of directed DE differentiation. To test our hypothesis, we cultured the cells for 6 days in two dimensional (2D) monolayer colony cultures, or as embryoid bodies (EBs) in either static conditions or, dynamically, in the rotary BRs. We used flow cytometry and qPCR to analyze the expression of marker proteins and genes, respectively, for pluripotency (Oct3/4) and mesendodermal (Brachyury T), endodermal (FoxA2, Sox17, CxCr4), and mesodermal (Vimentin, Meox1) lineages. Culture in the form of EBs in maintenance media (MM) in the presence of LIF, in static or SMG conditions, induced expression of some of the differentiation markers, suggesting heterogeneity of the cells. This is in line with previous studies showing that differentiation is initiated as cells are aggregated into EBs even without supplementing differentiation factors to the media. Culturing EBs in static conditions in differentiation media (DM) in the presence of activin A, reduced Oct3/4 expression, and significantly increased Brachyury T and CxCr4 expression, but downregulated FoxA2 and Sox17. However, culturing in SMG BRs in DM upregulated Brachyury T and all of the DE markers, and reduced Oct3/4 expression, indicating the advantage of dynamic cultures in BRs to specifically enhance directed DE differentiation. Given the potential discrepancies between the SMG conditions on earth and actual microgravity conditions, as observed in other studies, future experiments in space flight are required to validate the effects of reduced gravity on mESCs differentiation.",

        "abstract": "The results demonstrate that optimization of activin-A is important for differentiation of iPSC line and the replacement of FBS with KSR can improve the efficiency of i PSC differentiation toward DE. The first step in differentiation of pluripotent stem cell toward endoderm-derived cell/organ is differentiation to definitive endoderm (DE) which is the central issue in developmental biology. Based on several evidences, we hypothesized that activin-A optimization as well as replacement of fetal bovine serum (FBS) with knockout serum replacement (KSR) is important for differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line into DE. Therefore, a stepwise differentiation protocol was applied on R1-hiPSC1 cell line. At first, activin-A concentration (30, 50, 70 and 100\u00a0ng/ml) was optimized. Then, substitution of FBS with KSR was evaluated across four treatment groups. The amount of differentiation of iPSC toward DE was determined by quantitative gene expression analyses of pluripotency ( NANOG and OCT4 ), definitive endoderm ( SOX17 and FOXA2 ) and endoderm-derived organs ( PDX1 , NEUROG3, and PAX6 ). Based on gene expression analyses, the more decrease in concentrations of activin-A can increase the differentiation of iPSC into DE, therefore, 30\u00a0ng/ml activin-A was chosen as the best concentration for the differentiation of R1-hiPSC1 line toward endoderm-derived organ. Moreover, complete replacement of FBS with gradually increased KSR improved the differentiation of iPSC toward DE. For this reason, the addition of 0% KSR at day 1, 0.2% at day 2 and 2% for the next 3\u00a0days was the best optimal protocol of the differentiation of iPSC toward DE. Overall, our results demonstrate that optimization of activin-A is important for differentiation of iPSC line. Furthermore, the replacement of FBS with KSR can improve the efficiency of iPSC differentiation toward DE.",

The generation of human stem cell-derived spheroids and organoids represents a major step in solving numerous medical, pharmacological, and biological challenges. Due to the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems and the diverse applications of human pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived definitive endoderm (DE), we studied the influence of spheroid size and 3D cell culture systems on spheroid morphology and the effectiveness of DE differentiation as assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and computational modeling. Among the tested hydrogel-based 3D systems, we found that basement membrane extract (BME) hydrogel could not retain spheroid morphology due to dominant cell\u2013matrix interactions. On the other hand, we found that nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) hydrogel could maintain spheroid morphology but impeded growth factor diffusion, thereby negatively affecting cell differentiation. In contrast, suspension culture provided sufficient mass transfer and was demonstrated by protein expression assays, morphological analyses, and mathematical modeling to be superior to the hydrogel-based systems. In addition, we found that spheroid size was reversely correlated with the effectiveness of DE formation. However, spheroids of insufficient sizes failed to retain 3D morphology during differentiation in all the studied culture conditions. We hereby demonstrate how the properties of a chosen biomaterial influence the differentiation process and the importance of spheroid size control for successful human iPSC differentiation. Our study provides critical parametric information for the generation of human DE-derived, tissue-specific organoids in future studies.",

Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) represent an interesting clinical alternative to human embryonic (hESCs) and induced pluripotent (hiPSCs) stem cells in regenerative medicine. The potential of hAECs can be enhanced ex vivo by their partial pre-differentiation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 18-day differentiation of hAECs into endodermal cells, hepatic precursor cells, and cells showing functional features of hepatocytes using culture media supplemented with high (100 ng/mL) concentrations of EGF or HGF. The cells obtained after differentiation showed changes in morphology and increased expression of AFP, ALB, CYP3A4, CYP3A7, and GSTP1 genes. HGF was more effective than EGF in increasing the expression of liver-specific genes in hAECs. However, EGF stimulated the differentiation process more efficiently and yielded more hepatocyte-like cells capable of synthesizing \u03b1-fetoprotein during differentiation. Additionally, after 18 days, GST transferases, albumin, and CYP P450s, which proved their partial functionality, were expressed. In summary, HGF and EGF at a dose of 100 ng/mL can be successfully used to obtain hepatocyte-like cells between days 7 and 18 of hAEC differentiation. However, the effectiveness of this process is lower compared with hiPSC differentiation; therefore, optimization of the composition of the medium requires further research.",

Background Various methods have been developed to generate hepatic cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that rely on the combined use of multiple expensive growth factors, limiting industrial-scale production and widespread applications. Small molecules offer an attractive alternative to growth factors for producing hepatic cells since they are more economical and relatively stable. Methods We dissect small-molecule combinations and identify the ideal cocktails to achieve an optimally efficient and cost-effective strategy for hepatic cells differentiation, expansion, and maturation. Results We demonstrated that small-molecule cocktail CIP (including CHIR99021, IDE1, and PD0332991) efficiently induced definitive endoderm (DE) formation via increased endogenous TGF-\u03b2/Nodal signaling. Furthermore, we identified that combining Vitamin C, Dihexa, and Forskolin (VDF) could substitute growth factors to induce hepatic specification. The obtained hepatoblasts (HBs) could subsequently expand and mature into functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) by the established chemical formulas. Thus, we established a stepwise strategy with complete small molecules for efficiently producing scalable HBs and functionally matured HLCs. The small-molecule-derived HLCs displayed typical functional characteristics as mature hepatocytes in vitro and repopulating injured liver in vivo. Conclusion Our current small-molecule-based hepatic generation protocol presents an efficient and cost-effective platform for the large-scale production of functional human hepatic cells for cell-based therapy and drug discovery using.",

A definitive endodermal cell lineage is a prerequisite for the efficient generation of mature endoderm derivatives that give rise to organs, such as the pancreas and liver. We previously reported that the induction of mesenchymal definitive endoderm cells depends on autocrine TGF-\u03b2 signaling and that pharmacological blockage of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by Repsox disrupts endoderm specification. The definitive endoderm arises from a primitive streak, which depends largely on TGF-\u03b2 signaling. If the TGF-\u03b2 pathway is blocked by Repsox, cell fate after the primitive streak induction is so-far unknown. We report here, that an induced primitive streak cell-population contained many T/SOX2 co-expressing cells, and subsequent inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by Repsox promoted neuroectodermal cell fate, which was characterized using single-cell qPCR analysis and immunostaining. The process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which is inherent to the process of definitive endoderm differentiation, was also disrupted upon Repsox treatment. Our findings may provide a new approach to produce neural progenitors.",

For these applications, the in vitro PSC differentiation process must be elaborately investigated and controlled to reliably obtain the desired end products. However, because traditional experimental methods, such as one factor at a time or brute\u2010force approaches, are impractical for detailed screening of complex PSC cultivation conditions, more strategic and effective screening based on statistical design of experiments (DOE) ought to be indispensable. Among various DOE approaches, we regard robust parameter design (RPD) as particularly suited for differentiation protocol optimization due to its suitability for multifactorial screening. We confirmed the adaptability of RPD for investigating human induced PSC lineage specification toward anterior\u2010posterior gut tube endodermal cells and clarified both the contribution of each cell signaling pathway and the effect of cell signaling condition alteration on marker RNA expression levels, while increasing the efficiency of the screening in 243\u2010fold (18 vs 4374) compared with that of a brute\u2010force approach. Specific induction of anterior foregut, hepatic, pancreatic, or mid\u2010hindgut cells was achieved using seven iPSC strains with the optimal culture protocols established on the basis of RPD analysis. RPD has the potential to enable efficient construction and optimization of PSC differentiation protocols, and its use is recommended from fundamental research to mass production of PSC\u2010derived products.",

Directed differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into hepatocytes could provide an unlimited source of liver cells, and therefore holds great promise for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, drug screening and toxicology studies. Various methods have been established during the past decade to differentiate human iPSCs into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) using growth factors and/or small molecules. However, direct comparison of the differentiation efficiency and the quality of the final HLCs between different methods has rarely been reported. In the current study, two hepatocyte differentiation methods were devised, termed Method 1 and 2, through modifying existing well-known hepatocyte differentiation strategies, and the resultant cells were compared phenotypically and functionally at different stages of hepatocyte differentiation. Compared to Method 1, higher differentiation efficiency and reproducibility were observed in Method 2, which generated highly homogeneous functional HLCs at the end of the differentiation process. The cells exhibited morphology closely resembling primary human hepatocytes and expressed high levels of hepatic protein markers. More importantly, these HLCs demonstrated several essential characteristics of mature hepatocytes, including major serum protein (albumin, fibronectin and \u03b1-1 antitrypsin) secretion, urea release, glycogen storage and inducible cytochrome P450 activity. Further transcriptomic comparison of the HLCs derived from the two methods identified 1,481 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); 290 Gene Ontology terms in the biological process category were enriched by these genes, which were further categorized into 34 functional classes. Pathway analysis of the DEGs identified several signaling pathways closely involved in hepatocyte differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, including \u2018signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells\u2019, \u2018Wnt signaling pathway\u2019, \u2018TGF-beta signaling pathway\u2019 and \u2018PI3K-Akt signaling pathway\u2019. These results may provide a molecular basis for the differences observed between the two differentiation methods and suggest ways to further improve hepatocyte differentiation in order to obtain more mature HLCs for biomedical applications.",

Aims: It is crucial to establish an effective method to improve mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hepatic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells transplantation. Herein, we aim to explore whether sodium butyrate (NaB) enhances hepatic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) under liver-specific factors induction in vitro. Methods: We isolated BM-MSCs from the mononuclear cell fraction of rabbit bone marrow samples, and identified these cells by immunophenotype analysis. We then investigated the effects of different concentrations and different induced conditions. The histone deacetylase inhibitor NaB induced hepatic differentiation of BM-MSCs under liver-specific factors induction in vitro. BM-MSCs cultured in basic medium without the differentiation stimuli were set as the control. Morphological features, liver-specific gene and protein expression, and functional analyses were assessed to evaluate hepatic differentiation of BM-MSCs. Results: Our results showed that the persistence of NaB inhibited the expression of liver-specific protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. When NaB was continuously induced, all the four concentrations used were not conducive to induce hepatocyte transformation, but the low concentrations (0.5 and 1.0 mM) were relatively better. We found that the induction efficiency of NaB 24h pre-treatment was higher than that of NaB continuous intervention for 0.5 mM or 1.0 mM conditions, and higher than liver-specific factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (AGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) without NaB. Conclusion: Continuous NaB treatment can inhibit BMMSCs proliferation with concentration-dependence in a certain concentration range. 24h pre-treatment can enhance hepatic differentiation of BM-MSCs under liver-specific factors induction in vitro.",

For the production and bio-banking of differentiated derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in large quantities for drug screening and cellular therapies, well-defined and robust procedures for differentiation and cryopreservation are required. Definitive endoderm (DE) gives rise to respiratory and digestive epithelium, as well as thyroid, thymus, liver, and pancreas. Here, we present a scalable, universal process for the generation of DE from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Optimal control during the differentiation process was attained in chemically-defined and xeno-free suspension culture, and high flexibility of the workflow was achieved by the introduction of an efficient cryopreservation step at the end of DE differentiation. DE aggregates were capable of differentiating into hepatic-like, pancreatic, intestinal, and lung progenitor cells. Scale-up of the differentiation process using stirred-tank bioreactors enabled production of large quantities of DE aggregates. This process provides a useful advance for versatile applications of DE lineages, in particular for cell therapies and drug screening.",

        "abstract": "A process for the mass production and cryopreservation of definitive endodermal cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells using a chemically defined, xeno-free suspension culture in stirred tank bioreactors or rotating Erlenmeyer flasks is described. The endodermal germ layer gives rise to respiratory epithelium, hepatocytes, pancreatic cells and intestinal lineages, among other cell types. These lineages can be differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) via a common definitive endoderm (DE) intermediate that is characterized by the co-expression of the cell surface markers CXCR4, c-KIT and EPCAM and the transcription factors SOX17 and FOXA2. Here we provide a detailed protocol for mass production of DE from hPSCs in scalable and easy-to-handle suspension culture using a rotating Erlenmeyer flask or a sophisticated, fully controllable, 150-ml stirred tank bioreactor. This protocol uses two different media formulations that are chemically defined and xeno free and therefore good manufacturing practice ready. Our protocol allows for efficient hPSC-derived DE specification in multicellular aggregates within 3 days and generates up to 1 \u00d7 108 DE cells with >92% purity in one differentiation batch when using the bioreactor. The hPSC-derived DE cells that are generated can be cryopreserved for later downstream differentiation into various endodermal lineages. This protocol should facilitate the flexible production of mature DE derivatives for physiologically relevant disease models, high-throughput drug screening, toxicology testing and cellular therapies. The authors describe a process for the mass production and cryopreservation of definitive endodermal cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells using a chemically defined, xeno-free suspension culture in stirred tank bioreactors or rotating Erlenmeyer flasks.",

The generation of human stem cell-derived spheroids and organoids represents a major step in solving numerous medical, pharmacological, and biological challenges. Due to the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems and the diverse applications of human pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived definitive endoderm (DE), we studied the influence of spheroid size and 3D cell culture systems on spheroid morphology and the effectiveness of DE differentiation as assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and computational modeling. Among the tested hydrogel-based 3D systems, we found that basement membrane extract (BME) hydrogel could not retain spheroid morphology due to dominant cell\u2013matrix interactions. On the other hand, we found that nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) hydrogel could maintain spheroid morphology but impeded growth factor diffusion, thereby negatively affecting cell differentiation. In contrast, suspension culture provided sufficient mass transfer and was demonstrated by protein expression assays, morphological analyses, and mathematical modeling to be superior to the hydrogel-based systems. In addition, we found that spheroid size was reversely correlated with the effectiveness of DE formation. However, spheroids of insufficient sizes failed to retain 3D morphology during differentiation in all the studied culture conditions. We hereby demonstrate how the properties of a chosen biomaterial influence the differentiation process and the importance of spheroid size control for successful human iPSC differentiation. Our study provides critical parametric information for the generation of human DE-derived, tissue-specific organoids in future studies.",

Liver organoids (LOs) are receiving considerable attention for their potential use in drug screening, disease modeling, and transplantable constructs. Hepatocytes, as the key component of LOs, are isolated from the liver or differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). PSC-derived hepatocytes are preferable because of their availability and scalability. However, efficient maturation of the PSC-derived hepatocytes towards functional units in LOs remains a challenging subject. The incorporation of cell-sized microparticles (MPs) derived from liver extracellular matrix (ECM), could provide an enriched tissue-specific microenvironment for further maturation of hepatocytes inside the LOs. In the present study, the MPs were fabricated by chemical cross-linking of a water-in-oil dispersion of digested decellularized sheep liver. These MPs were mixed with human PSC-derived hepatic endoderm, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells to produce homogenous bioengineered LOs (BLOs). This approach led to the improvement of hepatocyte-like cells in terms of gene expression and function, CYP activities, albumin secretion, and metabolism of xenobiotics. The intraperitoneal transplantation of BLOs in an acute liver injury mouse model led to an enhancement in survival rate. Furthermore, efficient hepatic maturation was demonstrated after ex ovo transplantation. In conclusion, the incorporation of cell-sized tissue-specific MPs in BLOs improved the maturation of human PSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells compared to LOs. This approach provides a versatile strategy to produce functional organoids from different tissues and offers a novel tool for biomedical applications.",

Limited by the poor proliferation and restricted sources of adult hepatocytes, there is an urgent need to find substitutes for proliferation and cultivation of mature hepatocytes in vitro for use in disease treatment, drug approval, and toxicity testing. Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), which originate from undifferentiated stem cells or modified adult cells, are considered good candidates because of their advantages in terms of cell source and in vitro expansion ability. However, the majority of induced HLCs are in an immature state, and their degree of differentiation is heterogeneous, diminishing their usability in basic research and limiting their clinical application. Therefore, various methods have been developed to promote the maturation of HLCs, including chemical approaches, alteration of cell culture systems, and genetic manipulation, to meet the needs of in vivo transplantation and in vitro model establishment. This review proposes different cell types for the induction of HLCs, and provide a comprehensive overview of various techniques to promote the generation and maturation of HLCs in vitro.",

Developing technologies for scalable production of human organoids has gained increased attention for \u201corganoid medicine\u201d and drug discovery. We developed a scalable and integrated differentiation process for generation of hepatic organoid from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a fully controlled stirred tank bioreactor with 150\u2009ml working volume by application of physiological oxygen concentrations in different liver tissue zones. We found that the 20\u201340% dissolved oxygen concentration [DO] (corresponded to 30\u201360\u2009mmHg pO2 within the liver tissue) significantly influences the process outcome via regulating the differentiation fate of hPSC aggregates by enhancing mesoderm induction. Regulation of the [DO] at 30% DO resulted in efficient generation of human fetal\u2010like hepatic organoids that had a uniform size distribution and were comprised of red blood cells and functional hepatocytes, which exhibited improved liver\u2010specific marker gene expressions, key liver metabolic functions, and, more important, higher inducible cytochrome P450 activity compared to the other trials. These hepatic organoids were successfully engrafted in an acute liver injury mouse model and produced albumin after implantation. These results demonstrated the significant impact of the dissolved oxygen concentration on hPSC hepatic differentiation fate and differentiation efficacy that should be considered ascritical translational aspect of established scalable liver organoid generation protocols for potential clinical and drug discovery applications.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that DS played an important role in controlling the size of hPSC aggregates in 3D suspension culture by inhibiting the expression of ICAM1 coupled with the down-regulation of E-cad through the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Background Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have great potential in applications for regenerative medicine and drug development. However, 3D suspension culture systems for clinical-grade hPSC large-scale production have been a major challenge. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the addition of dextran sulfate (DS) could prevent excessive adhesion of hPSCs from forming larger aggregates in 3D suspension culture. However, the signaling and molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Methods By using a cell aggregate culture assay and separating big and small aggregates in suspension culture systems, the potential mechanism and downstream target genes of DS were investigated by mRNA sequence analysis, qRT-PCR validation, colony formation assay, and interference assay. Results Since cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) play important roles in hPSC adhesion and aggregation, we assumed that DS might prevent excess adhesion through affecting the expression of CAMs in hPSCs. As expected, after DS treatment, we found that the expression of CAMs was significantly down-regulated, especially E-cadherin (E-cad) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), two highly expressed CAMs in hPSCs. The role of E-cad in the adhesion of hPSCs has been widely investigated, but the function of ICAM1 in hPSCs is hardly understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that ICAM1 exhibited the capacity to promote the adhesion in hPSCs, and this adhesion was suppressed by the treatment with DS. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq revealed that DS treatment up-regulated genes related to Wnt signaling resulting in the activation of Wnt signaling in which SLUG, TWIST, and MMP3/7 were highly expressed, and further inhibited the expression of E-cad. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that DS played an important role in controlling the size of hPSC aggregates in 3D suspension culture by inhibiting the expression of ICAM1 coupled with the down-regulation of E-cad through the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. These results represent a significant step toward developing the expansion of hPSCs under 3D suspension condition in large-scale cultures.",

Liver disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, leading to the death of approximately 2 million people per year. Current therapies include orthotopic liver transplantation, however, donor organ shortage remains a great challenge. In addition, the development of novel therapeutics has been limited due to the lack of in vitro models that mimic in vivo liver physiology. Accordingly, hepatic cell lineages derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent a promising cell source for liver cell therapy, disease modelling, and drug discovery. Moreover, the development of new culture systems bringing together the multiple liver-specific hepatic cell types triggered the development of hPSC-derived liver organoids. Therefore, these human liver-based platforms hold great potential for clinical applications. In this review, the production of the different hepatic cell lineages from hPSCs, including hepatocytes, as well as the emerging strategies to generate hPSC-derived liver organoids will be assessed, while current biomedical applications will be highlighted.",

        "abstract": "This study indicates that artificial intelligence is able to guide and iteratively optimize PSC differentiation to achieve consistently high efficiency across cell lines and batches, providing a better understanding and rational modulation of the differentiation process for functional cell manufacturing in biomedical applications. The differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into diverse functional cell types provides a promising solution to support drug discovery, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine. However, functional cell differentiation is currently limited by the substantial line-to-line and batch-to-batch variabilities, which severely impede the progress of scientific research and the manufacturing of cell products. For instance, PSC-to-cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation is vulnerable to inappropriate doses of CHIR99021 (CHIR) that are applied in the initial stage of mesoderm differentiation. Here, by harnessing live-cell bright-field imaging and machine learning (ML), we realize real-time cell recognition in the entire differentiation process, e.g., CMs, cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), PSC clones, and even misdifferentiated cells. This enables non-invasive prediction of differentiation efficiency, purification of ML-recognized CMs and CPCs for reducing cell contamination, early assessment of the CHIR dose for correcting the misdifferentiation trajectory, and evaluation of initial PSC colonies for controlling the start point of differentiation, all of which provide a more invulnerable differentiation method with resistance to variability. Moreover, with the established ML models as a readout for the chemical screen, we identify a CDK8 inhibitor that can further improve the cell resistance to the overdose of CHIR. Together, this study indicates that artificial intelligence is able to guide and iteratively optimize PSC differentiation to achieve consistently high efficiency across cell lines and batches, providing a better understanding and rational modulation of the differentiation process for functional cell manufacturing in biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "The results suggest that dECM-derived scaffold improves the differentiation of DE cells towards lung alveolar progenitor cells in comparison with dECm-derived hydrogel and fibronectin-coated plates. Objective: Efficient production of functional and mature alveolar epithelial is a major challenge for developing any cell replacement therapy for lung degenerative diseases. The extracellular matrix (ECM) pro-vides a dynamic environment and mediates cellular responses during development and maintenance of tissue functions. The decellularized ECM (dECM) which retains its native-like structure and bio-chemical composition can provide the induction of embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation toward the tissue-specific lineages during in vitro culture. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sheep lung dECM-derived scaffold on differentiation and further maturation of ESC-derived lung progenitor cells. Materials and Methods: This study was an experimental study. In the first step, a sheep lung was decellularized to achieve dECM scaffolds and hydrogels. Afterwards, the obtained dECM scaffold was evaluated for collagen and glycosaminoglycan contents, DNA quantification, and its ultrastructure. Next, the three experimental groups: i. Sheep lung dECM-derived scaffold, ii. Sheep lung dECM-derived hydrogel, and iii. Fibronectin-coated plates were compared in their abilities to induce further differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived definitive endoderm (DE) into lung progenitor cells. The comparison was evaluated by immuno-staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assessments. Results: We found that the dECM-derived scaffold preserved its composition and native porous structures while lacking nuclei and intact cells. All experimental groups displayed lung progenitor cell differen-tiation as revealed by the RNA and protein expression of NKX2.1, P63 and CK5. DE cells differenti-ated on dECM-derived scaffold and dECMderived hydrogel showed significant upregulation of SOX9 gene expression, a marker of the distal airway epithelium. DE cells differentiated on the dECM-derived scaffold compared to the two other groups, showed enhanced expression of SFTPC (type 2 alveolar epithelial [AT2] cell marker), FOXJ1 (ciliated cell marker), and MUC5A (secretory cell marker) genes. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that dECM-derived scaffold improves the differentiation of DE cells towards lung alveolar progenitor cells in comparison with dECM-derived hydrogel and fibronectin-coated plates.",

BackgroundLung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have a high incidence worldwide. The current drug therapies for ARDS have supportive effects, making them inefficient. New methods such as stromal cell therapy are needed for this problem.MethodsThis research was performed with ten New Zealand rabbits in two groups. Bone marrow aspiration was performed on the treated group, and mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured. The experimental model of ARDS was induced using LPS from Escherichia coli strain O55:B5. Then, 1010 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were autologously transplanted intrapulmonary in the treatment group, and 1\u20132\u2009ml of PBS in the control group. The clinical signs, computed tomographic (CT) scans, echocardiography, blood gas analysis, complete blood count, and cytokine levels were measured before and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168\u2009h after BM-MSC transplant. Finally, the rabbits were killed, and histopathological examination was performed.ResultsThe results showed that BM-MSCs decreased the severity of clinical symptoms, the number of white blood cells and heterophils in the blood, the total cell count, and number of heterophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage, and balanced the values of arterial blood gases (increase in partial pressure of oxygen and O2 saturation and decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide). They also downregulated the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations and increased the IL-10 concentrations at different times compared with time 0 and in the control group, significantly. In the CT scan, a significant decrease in the Hounsfield units and total lung volume was found by echocardiography, and in comparing the two groups, a significant difference in the parameters was noticed. The histopathology demonstrated that the BM-MSCs were able to reduce the infiltration of inflammatory cells and pulmonary hemorrhage and edema.ConclusionsThis study indicated that BM-MSCs play a significant role in the repair of lung injury.",

The total lung volume and the Hounsfield unit by CT-scan and the cardiac parameters by echocardiography were calculated before of ARDS (time -24) and cells/PBS infusion time(time 0) and then for 6,12,24,48,72,168h after cells/PBS infusion. At the end, the sheep were sacrificed and the hearts and lungs were macroscopically and microscopically checked.Results: The results showed the total lung volume and the Hounsfield unit increased at time 0, but BM-MSCs declined their amount, so that the changes were significant at 168h compared with time 0 and comparisons between the two-groups represented the significant difference at 72h and 168h. The cardiac parameters did not changes significantly in the two-groups at different times but the comparison between them demonstrated significant difference in LVPWs, IVSs,IVSd,%FS,RVOTVmax,LA(d1) and AO(d2) at 168 h, LVIDs,ESV and %EF at 72h and 168h and LVPWd at 72h. Also, the histopathology findings indicated decline of inflammatory reactions, edema, hemorrhage and hyperemia in the respiratory system and no observation of damage to the heart compared with the control-group. Conclusions: The results determined BM-MSCs in ARDS decrease edema and inflammation of the lungs and increase the alveoli air volume and prevent damage to heart function.",

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. A key histopathological feature of BPD is stunted late lung development, where the process of alveolarization -the generation of alveolar gas exchange units- is impeded, through mechanisms that remain largely unclear. As such, there is interest in the clarification both of the pathomechanisms at play in affected lungs, and the mechanisms of de novo alveoli generation in healthy, developing lungs. A better understanding of normal and pathological alveolarization might reveal opportunities for improved medical management of affected infants. Furthermore, disturbances to the alveolar architecture are a key histopathological feature of several adult chronic lung diseases, including emphysema and fibrosis; and it is envisaged that knowledge about the mechanisms of alveologenesis might facilitate regeneration of healthy lung parenchyma in affected patients. To this end, recent efforts have interrogated clinical data, developed new -and refined existing- in vivo and in vitro models of BPD, have applied new microscopic and radiographic approaches, and have developed advanced cell\u2011culture approaches, including organoid generation. Advances have also been made in the development of other methodologies, including single-cell analysis, metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics; as well as the generation and use of complex mouse genetics tools. The objective of this review is to present advances made in our understanding of the mechanisms of lung alveolarization and BPD over the period 01 January 2017 - 30 June 2019, a period that spans the 50th anniversary of the original clinical description of BPD in preterm infants.",

In the present study, mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were differentiated into alveolar epithelial type II (AEII) cells for endotracheal injection. These enriched lung-like populations expressed lung epithelial markers SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and CC10. First we show that rapid differentiation of ESCs requires a dissociated seeding method instead of an embryoid body culture method. We then investigated a two-step differentiation of ESCs into definitive endoderm by activin or A549-conditioned medium as a precursor to lung epithelial cells. When conditioned medium from A549 cells was used to derive endoderm, yield was increased above that of activin alone. Further studies showed that Wnt3a may be one of the secreted factors produced by A549 cells and promotes definitive endoderm differentiation, in part, through suppression of primitive endoderm. Activin and Wnt3a together at appropriate doses with dissociated cell seeding promoted greater endoderm yield than activin alone. Next, fibroblast growth factor 2 was shown to induce a dose-dependent expression of SPC, and these cells contained lamellar bodies characteristic of mature AEII cells from ESC-derived endoderm. Finally, ES-derived lung cells were endotracheally injected into preterm mice with evidence of AEII distribution within the lung parenchyma. This study concludes that a recapitulation of development may enhance derivation of an enriched population of lung-like cells for use in cell-based therapy.",

Embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency is being investigated increasingly to obtain specific cell lineages for tissue engineering. However, the possibility that ES cells can give rise to lung tissue has not been tested. We hypothesized that lung epithelial cells (type II pneumocytes) can be derived in vitro from murine ES cells. After withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and formation of embryoid bodies in maintenance medium for 10, 20, and 30 days, differentiating ES cells were kept in the same medium or transferred to serum-free small airway growth medium (SAGM) for a further 3 or 14 days of culture. The presence of type II pneumocytes in the resulting mixed cultures was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of surfactant protein C (SPC) mRNA, immunostaining of SPC, and electron microscopy of osmiophilic lamellar bodies only at 30 days sampling time. SAGM appeared to be more favorable for type II cell formation than ES medium. No SPC transcripts were found in differentiating cells grown under the same conditions without formation of embryoid bodies. These findings could form the basis for the enrichment of ES cell-derived cultures with type II pneumocytes, and provide an in vitro system for investigating mechanisms of lung repair and regeneration.",

The potential of human embryonic stem (hES) cells to differentiate into cell types of a variety of organs has generated much excitement over the possible use of hES cells in therapeutic applications. Of great interest are organs derived from definitive endoderm, such as the pancreas. We have focused on directing hES cells to the definitive endoderm lineage as this step is a prerequisite for efficient differentiation to mature endoderm derivatives. Differentiation of hES cells in the presence of activin A and low serum produced cultures consisting of up to 80% definitive endoderm cells. This population was further enriched to near homogeneity using the cell-surface receptor CXCR4.

Alveolar epithelial type II (ATII)-like cells can be generated from murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs), although to date, no robust protocols applying specific differentiation factors are established. We hypothesized that the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an important mediator of lung organogenesis and primary ATII cell maturation and proliferation, together with dexamethasone, 8-bromoadenosine-cAMP, and isobutylmethylxanthine (DCI), which induce maturation of primary fetal ATII cells, also support the alveolar differentiation of murine ESCs. Here we demonstrate that the above stimuli synergistically potentiate the alveolar differentiation of ESCs as indicated by increased expression of the surfactant proteins (SP-) C and SP-B. This effect is most profound if KGF is supplied not only in the late stage, but at least also during the intermediate stage of differentiation. Our results indicate that KGF most likely does not enhance the generation of (mes)endodermal or NK2 homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1) expressing progenitor cells but rather, supported by DCI, accelerates further differentiation/maturation of respiratory progeny in the intermediate phase and maturation/proliferation of emerging ATII cells in the late stage of differentiation. Ultrastructural analyses confirmed the presence of ATII-like cells with intracellular composite and lamellar bodies. Finally, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from transgenic mice with ATII cell-specific lacZ reporter expression. Again, KGF and DCI synergistically increased SP-C and SP-B expression in iPSC cultures, and lacZ expressing ATII-like cells developed. In conclusion, ATII cell-specific reporter expression enabled the first reliable proof for the generation of murine iPSC-derived ATII cells. In addition, we have shown KGF and DCI to synergistically support the generation of ATII-like cells from ESCs and iPSCs. Combined application of these factors will facilitate more efficient generation of stem cell-derived ATII cells for future basic research and potential therapeutic application.",

Embryonic stem (ES) cells hold great promise with respect to their potential to be differentiated into desired cell types. Of interest are organs derived from the definitive endoderm, such as the pancreas and liver, and animal studies have revealed an essential role for Nodal in development of the definitive endoderm. Activin A is a related TGF\u03b2 member that acts through many of the same downstream signaling effectors as Nodal and is thought to mimic Nodal activity. Detailed characterization of ES cell-derived endodermal cell types by gene expression analysis in vitro and functional analysis in vivo reveal that, despite their similarity in gene expression, Nodal and Activin-derived endodermal cells exhibit a distinct difference in functional competence following transplantation into the developing mouse embryo. Pdx1-expressing cells arising from the respective endoderm populations exhibit extended differences in their competence to mature into insulin/c-peptide-expressing cells in vivo. Our findings underscore the importance of functional cell-type evaluation during stepwise differentiation of stem cells.",

The first step in differentiation of pluripotent stem cell toward endoderm-derived cell/organ is differentiation to definitive endoderm (DE) which is the central issue in developmental biology. Based on several evidences, we hypothesized that activin-A optimization as well as replacement of fetal bovine serum (FBS) with knockout serum replacement (KSR) is important for differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line into DE. Therefore, a stepwise differentiation protocol was applied on R1-hiPSC1 cell line. At first, activin-A concentration (30, 50, 70 and 100\u00a0ng/ml) was optimized. Then, substitution of FBS with KSR was evaluated across four treatment groups. The amount of differentiation of iPSC toward DE was determined by quantitative gene expression analyses of pluripotency ( NANOG and OCT4 ), definitive endoderm ( SOX17 and FOXA2 ) and endoderm-derived organs ( PDX1 , NEUROG3, and PAX6 ). Based on gene expression analyses, the more decrease in concentrations of activin-A can increase the differentiation of iPSC into DE, therefore, 30\u00a0ng/ml activin-A was chosen as the best concentration for the differentiation of R1-hiPSC1 line toward endoderm-derived organ. Moreover, complete replacement of FBS with gradually increased KSR improved the differentiation of iPSC toward DE. For this reason, the addition of 0% KSR at day 1, 0.2% at day 2 and 2% for the next 3\u00a0days was the best optimal protocol of the differentiation of iPSC toward DE. Overall, our results demonstrate that optimization of activin-A is important for differentiation of iPSC line. Furthermore, the replacement of FBS with KSR can improve the efficiency of iPSC differentiation toward DE.",

Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are considered to be potentially able to differentiate into all human cell lineages and thus hold promise as an unlimited source for cell replacement therapies in clinical applications. Definitive endoderm (DE) formation is the first and crucial step in the development of visceral organs such as liver, lung, pancreas and so forth. Therefore, efficient generation of DE cells ensures the efficient generation of eventual target cells used in cell therapy. In the present study, Matrigel-coated poly(lactic acid)/gelatin (PLA/gelatin) nanofibrous scaffolds were utilized to investigate the proliferation and differentiation of hiPSCs into DE cells. Analyses of DE-specific markers including Sox17, FoxA2, and Gooscoid (Gsc) genes revealed higher levels of mRNA and protein expression in the differentiated hiPSCs cells cultured on PLA/gelatin scaffolds than cells differentiated in two-dimensional (2D) culture. Our results showed that three-dimensional (3D) cultures could significantly promote DE differentiation in comparison with 2D culture. Also using small molecules such as inducer of definitive endoderm 1 (IDE1) and signaling molecules such as Activin A and Wnt3a could enhance the DE differentiation of hiPSCs with Activin A/Wnt3a being significantly more potent in both 2D and 3D cultures compared to IDE1. The results of this study may have impact in tissue engineering and cell replacement therapy of visceral organs-related diseases.",

The use of small molecules to \u2018chemically direct\u2019 differentiation represents a powerful approach to promote specification of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) towards particular functional cell types for use in regenerative medicine and pharmaceutical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel route for chemically directed differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) into definitive endoderm (DE) exploiting a selective small-molecule inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). This GSK-3 inhibitor, termed 1m, when used as the only supplement to a chemically defined feeder-free culture system, effectively promoted differentiation of ESC lines towards primitive streak (PS), mesoderm and DE. This contrasts with the role of GSK-3 in murine ESCs, where GSK-3 inhibition promotes pluripotency. Interestingly, 1m-mediated induction of differentiation involved transient NODAL expression and Nodal signalling. Prolonged treatment of hESCs with 1m resulted in the generation of a population of cells displaying hepatoblast characteristics, that is expressing \u03b1-fetoprotein and HNF4\u03b1. Furthermore, 1m-induced DE had the capacity to mature and generate hepatocyte-like cells capable of producing albumin. These findings describe, for the first time, the utility of GSK-3 inhibition, in a chemically directed approach, to a method of DE generation that is robust, potentially scalable and applicable to different hESC lines.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that generation of hESC\u2010DE requires two conditions: signaling by Activin/Nodal family members and release from inhibitory signals generated by PI3K through insulin/IGF. Human ESCs (hESCs) respond to signals that determine their pluripotency, proliferation, survival, and differentiation status. In this report, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase (PI3K) antagonizes the ability of hESCs to differentiate in response to transforming growth factor \u03b2 family members such as Activin A and Nodal. Inhibition of PI3K signaling efficiently promotes differentiation of hESCs into mesendoderm and then definitive endoderm (DE) by allowing them to be specified by Activin/Nodal signals present in hESC cultures. Under conditions where hESCs are grown in mouse embryo fibroblast\u2010conditioned medium under feeder\u2010free conditions, \u223c70%\u201380% are converted into DE following 5 days of treatment with inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, such as LY 294002 and AKT1\u2010II. Microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction\u2010based gene expression profiling demonstrates that definitive endoderm formation under these conditions closely parallels that following specification with elevated Activin A and low fetal calf serum (FCS)/knockout serum replacement (KSR). Reduced insulin/insulin\u2010like growth factor (IGF) signaling was found to be critical for cell fate commitment into DE. Levels of insulin/IGF present in FCS/KSR, normally used to promote self\u2010renewal of hESCs, antagonized differentiation. In summary, we show that generation of hESC\u2010DE requires two conditions: signaling by Activin/Nodal family members and release from inhibitory signals generated by PI3K through insulin/IGF. These findings have important implications for our understanding of hESC self\u2010renewal and early cell fate decisions.",

Scalable processes are requisite for the robust biomanufacturing of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)\u2010derived therapeutics. Toward this end, we demonstrate the xeno\u2010free expansion and directed differentiation of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells to definitive endoderm (DE) in a controlled stirred suspension bioreactor (SSB). Based on previous work on converting hPSCs to insulin\u2010producing progeny, differentiation of two hPSC lines was optimized in planar cultures yielding up to 87% FOXA2+/SOX17+ cells. Next, hPSCs were propagated in an SSB with controlled pH and dissolved oxygen. Cultures displayed a 10\u2010 to 12\u2010fold increase in cell number over 5\u20136 days with the maintenance of pluripotency (>85% OCT4+) and viability (>85%). For differentiation, SSB cultures yielded up to 89% FOXA2+/SOX17+ cells or ~ 8 DE cells per seeded hPSC. Specification to DE cell fate was consistently more efficient in the bioreactor compared to planar cultures. Hence, a tunable strategy is established that is suitable for the xeno\u2010free manufacturing of DE cells from different hPSC lines in scalable SSBs. This study advances bioprocess development for producing a wide gamut of human DE cell\u2010derived therapeutics.",

Background Due to their multipotency and ability for self-renewal, human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) hold great promise for generating hepatocytes. Previous research has successfully generated hepatocytes from early-passage [i.e., passage (P)3] hUC-MSCs; however, the populations of early-passage cells are limited, and these cells cannot produce sufficient functional hepatocytes for large-scale application in clinical therapy. Thus, a thorough investigation of the hepatic differentiation potential of in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs is needed. Methods hUC-MSCs were passaged in vitro and subcultured every 3 days up to P8, and their morphology, proliferative capacity, liver-specific marker expression, and liver function at the end of each passage were analyzed. The efficiency of the hepatogenic differentiation of hUC-MSCs driven by a functional hit 1 (FH1)-based strategy at different passages was also evaluated. Results The in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs gradually displayed morphological inhomogeneity, had reduced proliferative capability, and exhibited senescent properties while maintaining adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. Additionally, senescence also decreased the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in albumin (ALB) and alpha 1-antitrpsin (A1AT) in these cells and their relative protein expression, which is the marker of a mature hepatocyte. The liver function of the in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs also deteriorated gradually. Finally, the percentage of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) generated from in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs reduced significantly, and the mature hepatocyte functions, such as ALB secretion, glycogen synthesis, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) intake, and indocyanine green (ICG) uptake, also changed. Conclusions hUC-MSCs possess mature hepatocytes\u2019 specific markers and functions, which change gradually as they undergo cell senescence. Due to the loss of these properties within in vitro subcultures, the hepatic differentiation efficiency of in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs decreased dramatically in the late passage (P8). The current study provides valuable information can inform future research on liver disease.",

The generation of human stem cell-derived spheroids and organoids represents a major step in solving numerous medical, pharmacological, and biological challenges. Due to the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems and the diverse applications of human pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived definitive endoderm (DE), we studied the influence of spheroid size and 3D cell culture systems on spheroid morphology and the effectiveness of DE differentiation as assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and computational modeling. Among the tested hydrogel-based 3D systems, we found that basement membrane extract (BME) hydrogel could not retain spheroid morphology due to dominant cell\u2013matrix interactions. On the other hand, we found that nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) hydrogel could maintain spheroid morphology but impeded growth factor diffusion, thereby negatively affecting cell differentiation. In contrast, suspension culture provided sufficient mass transfer and was demonstrated by protein expression assays, morphological analyses, and mathematical modeling to be superior to the hydrogel-based systems. In addition, we found that spheroid size was reversely correlated with the effectiveness of DE formation. However, spheroids of insufficient sizes failed to retain 3D morphology during differentiation in all the studied culture conditions. We hereby demonstrate how the properties of a chosen biomaterial influence the differentiation process and the importance of spheroid size control for successful human iPSC differentiation. Our study provides critical parametric information for the generation of human DE-derived, tissue-specific organoids in future studies.",

The identification and characterization of stem cells, especially human embryonic stem cells, has revolutionized the field of developmental biology by providing an in vitro system to study human development. In addition, reprogramming adult cells from patients into an embryonic stem cell-like state using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology can potentially generate an unlimited source of human tissue carrying genetic mutations that caused or facilitated disease development, providing unprecedented possibilities to model human disease in the culture dish. To do this, however, efficient differentiation methods to direct iPSCs through multiple progenitor stages to yield homogeneous populations of somatic cells must be established. Furthermore, disease modeling using iPSCs requires proper controls for this \u201cdisease-in-a-dish\u201d approach. Therefore, methods to efficiently engineer the genome of iPSCs to correct the mutations become vital in stem cell research. Here we reviewed the iPSC generation techniques and several genome-editing tools, such as TALENs and CRISPR-Cas9, for performing iPSC gene knock-in and knockout. We also present several efficient stem cell directed differentiation methods for converting iPSCs to neural, hematopoietic, cardiac, and pancreatic lineages. Together, this knowledge will provide insight into design principles for disease modeling using iPSCs and stem cell-based therapies.",

        "abstract": "The hepatic differentiation medium with NaBu in the pre-treatment step can induce hWJ-MSC differentiation toward endodermal, hepatoblastic, and hepatic lineages, and could represent an alternative protocol for cell-based therapy and drug screening in clinical applications. Currently, human Wharton\u2019s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) are an attractive source of stem cells for cell-based therapy, owing to their ability to undergo self-renewal and differentiate into all mesodermal, some neuroectodermal, and endodermal progenies, including hepatocytes. Herein, this study aimed to investigate the effects of sodium butyrate (NaBu), an epigenetic regulator that directly inhibits histone deacetylase, on hepatic endodermal lineage differentiation of hWJ-MSCs. NaBu, at 1 mM, optimally promoted endodermal differentiation of hWJ-MSCs, along with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) supplementation. CXCR4, HNF3\u03b2, SOX17 (endodermal), and GATA6 (mesendodermal) mRNAs were also up-regulated (p < 0.001). Immunocytochemistry and a Western blot analysis of SOX17 and HNF3\u03b2 confirmed that the 1 mM NaBu along with EGF and bFGF supplementation condition was appropriately pre-treated with hWJ-MSCs before hepatogenic differentiation. Furthermore, the hepatic differentiation medium with NaBu pre-treatment up-regulated hepatoblast (AFP and HNF3\u03b2) and hepatic (CK18 and ALB) markers, and increased the proportion of mature hepatocyte functions, including G6P, C/EBP\u03b1, and CYP2B6 mRNAs, glycogen storage and urea secretion. The hepatic differentiation medium with NaBu in the pre-treatment step can induce hWJ-MSC differentiation toward endodermal, hepatoblastic, and hepatic lineages. Therefore, the hepatic differentiation medium with NaBu pre-treatment for differentiating hWJ-MSCs could represent an alternative protocol for cell-based therapy and drug screening in clinical applications.",

A shortage of postmortem pancreatic tissue for islet isolation impedes the application of cell replacement therapy in patients with diabetes. As an alternative for islet cell transplantation, transcription factors, including PDX1, PAX4, and neurogenin-3, that aid in the formation of insulin-producing \u03b2 cells during development have been investigated. The present study evaluated the effects of PAX4 and PDX1 on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into insulin-producing \u03b2-like cells in vitro using recombinant adenoviruses carrying PDX1 or PDX1 plus PAX4. RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression levels of relevant genes and proteins, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to determine the amount of insulin and C-peptide secreted by the virus-infected cells following stimulation with high glucose. The results showed that PAX4 markedly enhanced the propensity of PDX1-positive MSCs to form mature islet-like clusters and functional insulin-producing \u03b2-like cells. Our findings provide a novel foundation for generating \u03b2-like cells from MSCs with PAX4 and PDX1 for future clinical application.",

Background Various methods have been developed to generate hepatic cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that rely on the combined use of multiple expensive growth factors, limiting industrial-scale production and widespread applications. Small molecules offer an attractive alternative to growth factors for producing hepatic cells since they are more economical and relatively stable. Methods We dissect small-molecule combinations and identify the ideal cocktails to achieve an optimally efficient and cost-effective strategy for hepatic cells differentiation, expansion, and maturation. Results We demonstrated that small-molecule cocktail CIP (including CHIR99021, IDE1, and PD0332991) efficiently induced definitive endoderm (DE) formation via increased endogenous TGF-\u03b2/Nodal signaling. Furthermore, we identified that combining Vitamin C, Dihexa, and Forskolin (VDF) could substitute growth factors to induce hepatic specification. The obtained hepatoblasts (HBs) could subsequently expand and mature into functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) by the established chemical formulas. Thus, we established a stepwise strategy with complete small molecules for efficiently producing scalable HBs and functionally matured HLCs. The small-molecule-derived HLCs displayed typical functional characteristics as mature hepatocytes in vitro and repopulating injured liver in vivo.

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) possess great value for biomedical research. hPSCs can be scaled and differentiated to all cell types found in the human body. The differentiation of hPSCs to human hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) has been extensively studied, and efficient differentiation protocols have been established. The combination of extracellular matrix and biological stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and small molecules, have made it possible to generate HLCs that resemble primary human hepatocytes. However, the majority of procedures still employ undefined components, giving rise to batch-to-batch variation. This serves as a significant barrier to the application of the technology. To tackle this issue, we developed a defined system for hepatocyte differentiation using human recombinant laminins as extracellular matrices in combination with a serum-free differentiation process. Highly efficient hepatocyte specification was achieved, with demonstrated improvements in both HLC function and phenotype. Importantly, this system is easy to scale up using research and GMP-grade hPSC lines promising advances in cell-based modelling and therapies.",

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are being utilized in diverse areas of studies such as development and disease modeling, cell replacement therapy, or drug toxicity testing because of their potential to be differentiated into any cell type in the body. The directed differentiation of hESCs into hepatocytes could provide an invaluable source of liver cells for various liver-based applications. Therefore, several protocols have been established in the past for hESC-hepatocyte differentiation based on the knowledge of signaling pathways and growth factors involved in different stages of embryonic hepatogenesis. Although successful derivation of hepatocytes has been achieved through these protocols, the efficiency is not always ideal. Herein, we have tested several combinations of published protocols, for example, growth factor vs. small molecule and different time durations of treatment for definitive endoderm (DE) induction and further hepatocyte differentiation to develop an efficient DE induction and hepatocyte differentiation in a highly reproducible manner based on the stage-specific marker expression and functional analysis.",

Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this review is to provide an updated perspective on directing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to hepatocyte-like-cells (HLCs) and the associated challenges.Recent FindingsRecent advances in the hepatocyte differentiation field have largely been focused on increasing the reproducibility and definition of culture systems to further their translation to a clinical setting. There have been advances using new extracellular matrices such as human laminins, and recent work using small molecules to drive the differentiation process has dramatically reduced the cost of producing HLCs with equivalent phenotypes to growth factor-derived cells.SummaryThere are still several key aspects that remain unresolved, including the immature phenotype of hPSC-derived HLCs (a major hurdle for hPSC-derived progeny). Another key question is the zonal identity of the HLCs produced in vitro, which will have major implications in terms of disease modeling and drug metabolism. To date, there has been little investigation of this aspect of hepatic biology reported in the field.",

        "abstract": "The results may provide a molecular basis for the differences observed between the two differentiation methods and suggest ways to further improve hepatocyte differentiation in order to obtain more mature HLCs for biomedical applications. Directed differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into hepatocytes could provide an unlimited source of liver cells, and therefore holds great promise for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, drug screening and toxicology studies. Various methods have been established during the past decade to differentiate human iPSCs into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) using growth factors and/or small molecules. However, direct comparison of the differentiation efficiency and the quality of the final HLCs between different methods has rarely been reported. In the current study, two hepatocyte differentiation methods were devised, termed Method 1 and 2, through modifying existing well-known hepatocyte differentiation strategies, and the resultant cells were compared phenotypically and functionally at different stages of hepatocyte differentiation. Compared to Method 1, higher differentiation efficiency and reproducibility were observed in Method 2, which generated highly homogeneous functional HLCs at the end of the differentiation process. The cells exhibited morphology closely resembling primary human hepatocytes and expressed high levels of hepatic protein markers. More importantly, these HLCs demonstrated several essential characteristics of mature hepatocytes, including major serum protein (albumin, fibronectin and \u03b1-1 antitrypsin) secretion, urea release, glycogen storage and inducible cytochrome P450 activity. Further transcriptomic comparison of the HLCs derived from the two methods identified 1,481 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); 290 Gene Ontology terms in the biological process category were enriched by these genes, which were further categorized into 34 functional classes. Pathway analysis of the DEGs identified several signaling pathways closely involved in hepatocyte differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, including \u2018signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells\u2019, \u2018Wnt signaling pathway\u2019, \u2018TGF-beta signaling pathway\u2019 and \u2018PI3K-Akt signaling pathway\u2019. These results may provide a molecular basis for the differences observed between the two differentiation methods and suggest ways to further improve hepatocyte differentiation in order to obtain more mature HLCs for biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "These methodologies have shown to improve in vitro liver cell functionality according to the in vivo liver physiology and allow to establish stem cell-based hepatic in vitro platforms for the accurate evaluation of xenobiotics. Stem cells are characterized by their self-renewal capacity and their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types of the human body. Using directed differentiation strategies, stem cells can now be converted into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and therefore, represent a unique cell source for toxicological applications in vitro. However, the acquired hepatic functionality of stem cell-derived HLCs is still significantly inferior to primary human hepatocytes. One of the main reasons for this is that most in vitro models use traditional two-dimensional (2D) setups where the flat substrata cannot properly mimic the physiology of the human liver. Therefore, 2D-setups are progressively being replaced by more advanced culture systems, which attempt to replicate the natural liver microenvironment, in which stem cells can better differentiate towards HLCs. This review highlights the most recent cell culture systems, including scaffold-free and scaffold-based three-dimensional (3D) technologies and microfluidics that can be employed for culture and hepatic differentiation of stem cells intended for hepatotoxicity testing. These methodologies have shown to improve in vitro liver cell functionality according to the in vivo liver physiology and allow to establish stem cell-based hepatic in vitro platforms for the accurate evaluation of xenobiotics.",
